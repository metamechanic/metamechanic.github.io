- #amt With the proliferation of social media, we increasingly employ filters of source and "expert" to obtain news and "trusted" information. Is this not a metaphor of the world? symbolic of the world's process?
	- We get the messages and signals we want, that we ask for (unconsciously) but having forgotten or denied that we asked for them.
	- We filter for a reason, a purpose
		- to reinforce guilt and separation
		- to heal, forgive, and 'close the gap'
	- We say that we don't like the messages, that we didn't ask for those particular messages
	- Regarding bias, and claims of impartiality vs ackowledgment of bias
		- The illusion of real critical thinking...
			- Are older generations deluding themselves when they say they don't/didn't follow the crowd and actually thoughts for themselves?

	- Only as we change our minds
