Why do some not have enough? What do they not have enough of?
Are the reasons the experts give really true?
Is there actually enough? What does the data say? Is the data biased? Whose data? What assumptions are made?

Is there enough now? Was there enough in the past? Has there always been enough? Do forecasts predict enough? Why should we believe them? Why not believe them?

If there is enough, why don’t some have enough? What are the barriers and limiting mechanisms in play? Who or what erects those barriers and builds those mechanisms?

If there is not enough, could there be enough for all? What could be some of those tools for enough for all? Are common responses really effective? Are they true? What do the solutions hinge on for success?

Does everyone having enough mean some can’t have too much? Or will everyone having enough actually mean more could have more?
