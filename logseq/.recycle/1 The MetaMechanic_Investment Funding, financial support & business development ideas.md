Investment Funding, financial support & business development ideas
My vision is that all projects lead to thriving, financially viable organisations and/or brands. Each one will ultimately offer products and services to the broader economy, employing teams of researchers, consultants, web gurus and other support staff.

This may take some time to realise, as with any fledgling investment. Funding and business development expertise are sought to expedite the process and improve the result.
