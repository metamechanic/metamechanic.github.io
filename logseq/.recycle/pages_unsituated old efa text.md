# Unsituated old EFA text
- Enough For All: so that more may be more and have more.
- Stitching together the story of sufficiency
  collapsed:: true
	- Not new data. Not a truly original story.  Enough For All pieces together disparate data from numerous reliable, authoritative organisations into a message of insight and hope: There is enough for all. Everyone can have enough.  EFA aims to provide a novel, simple, engaging and comprehensive way of understanding a complex, compelling tale: the how much and how of enough.
- Overwhelming issues made visible, manageable and hopeful.
  collapsed:: true
	- Most of us feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and hopeless when we look at the scale of suffering and conflict. Many of us choose not to look for this reason.  Enough For All seeks to not only present data in a way that is digestible, but offer hope and mechanisms for alleviating suffering, resolving conflict and addressing poverties and inequalities.
- The story of the world, simplified and visualised
  collapsed:: true
	- The story of the world is the story of “more”. Money, power, security, food, control, time…and the search never ends. Much data on this already exists. Its a question of making sense of it.  Enough For All presents the data visually, drawing simple conclusions with logical consequences and deduction. The result:  a labyrinth of scarcity translated into an epic of enoughness.
- Illuminating the issue of enough
  collapsed:: true
	- Why do some not have enough? What do they not have enough of? Are the reasons the experts give really true? Is there actually enough? What does the data say? Is the data biased? Whose data? What assumptions are made?  Is there enough now? Was there enough in the past? Has there always been enough? Do forecasts predict enough? Why should we believe them? Why not believe them?  If there is enough, why don’t some have enough? What are the barriers and limiting mechanisms in play? Who or what erects those barriers and builds those mechanisms?  If there is not enough, could there be enough for all? What could be some of those tools for enough for all? Are common responses really effective? Are they true? What do the solutions hinge on for success?  Does everyone having enough mean some can’t have too much? Or will everyone having enough actually mean more could have more?
- Inspired Resource Utilization
  collapsed:: true
	- Enough For All seeks to identify proposals that address multiple layers of the sufficiency problem.  Perhaps there are already some systems and models out there which can do a better job of generating, supplying and distributing enough for all…  Why are they not in place?  Who says they will, or won’t, work?  EFA will explore the tried and tested, and present some Fresh Alternatives.
- Why do some not have enough?
  collapsed:: true
	- Why do some go hungry, malnourished, impoverished? Why are some homeless, landless and materially insecure? Why are some unhappy, unhealthy, unhelpful?  Have you ever asked yourself these questions? Have you ever wondered if there is more to the story than the answers you are given?  Enough For All seeks to address these questions and tell the story of sufficiency by starting with the basics, visualising the data, and using ‘warm logic’.
- Visualizing The Story of the World
  collapsed:: true
	- EFA sets out to piece together quality data and dedicated research into the story of enough  [Need diagram of story map…]
- Have you ever wondered why some don't have enough?
  collapsed:: true
	- I mean…really wondered?  Is there enough?  [Text boxes - images] ??  Enough stuff…food, water, land, shelter, clothing… Enough technology…energy, money, transport, medicine… Enough intangibles…happiness, health, love, peace…  [Perhaps use slider ‘rating’ bars. Set to 100%]  This was the inspiration for the project. It lead to the question, “Is there actually enough for everyone? That would be interesting to know. And if not, could there be, if we used alternative systems?”
- Not new data. Not an original story. A novel, simple and comprehensive way of understanding a complex, compelling story.
  collapsed:: true
	- #.meta-block
		- is this a meta block?
- Cohering disparate data into a message of insight and hope
- Community-curated multi-layered data portal
  collapsed:: true
	- Collation and Curation
		- Not a forum for repetition or rant. Contributed ideas and data are distilled into their essence and situated into the story. Not truth by consensus, but open to conversation, critique and debate.
		- Community
			- The story of the world requires the world to write it. Country analysts, issue specialists, topic experts all required. Data freaks, infographics geeks, and constructive critiques. We need you. UN, NGOs, EDUs, NPOs, VIPs, NFIs… all have a role to play.
		- Beyond a Data portal
			- Easy access to essential data. Starting hub for diverse information  Links to specialist organisations Multi-scale. Multi-scope. Search. Filter. Refine. Share.    Penetrate the problem. Seek and see solutions. Don’t drown in data.
- Web platform for a deep, data-driven narrative
  collapsed:: true
	- The base of Enough For All is a novel website piecing disparate data into a coherent narrative. It will allow user-driven plot pathways maintaining global meaning and connection between data and layers. The story structure allows deeper investigation as well as superficial story skimming. Enough For All needs web developers, data scientists, database programmers and content contributors to create this site.
- Reviewing conventional wisdom
  collapsed:: true
	- Insufficiency has always existed, despite/because of the efforts of policy implementers. Either: 1. You believe it always will continue to exist, regardless. This site is not for you. Q 2. Historical efforts have typically fallen short because of
- Simplifying complexity...just enough, not too much
  collapsed:: true
	- Reframing the problem in order to see effective solutions  The answer to complexity is not necessarily greater complexity.
- Making sense of immense, disparate data through a grand, visual, interactive narrative.
  collapsed:: true
	- Targeting effective triggers and solutions through a logical sequence of (in)sufficiency investigation
	- The Enough For All story structure follows a logical if-then questioning route to uncover problems, data, answers and supposed answers.  This way readers can discover  1. Issues and data,   2. attempts at addressing the issue,   3. assumptions and limitations in the data,   4. the layers and perspectives on the issue and its solutions  5. Linkages between complex issues and attempted solutions, and  6. Target trigger points for effective action  An important part of Enough For All is that readers can offer and inject insights and data into the pathway-network, keeping in mind that entry will be scrutinised by the community for novelty, uniqueness, overlap, pre-existence etc. The success of Enough For All relies on this very process.
- Complexity covers poverty and disguises solutions
  collapsed:: true
	- Using graphic tools, logic, web technology and knowledge mapping
	- A layered, global analysis of sufficiency integrated into an understandable and meaningful story
- Issue Mapping, Solution Cartography, Data Visualizations, Infographics
- Communicating data for easier intellectual digestion  Simplifying the story so real problems and effective solutions become more apparent.
- Issue Mapping
  collapsed:: true
	- Its already been written. The essays, articles, diatribes, rants…   See the flow of arguments and issues, pro’s and con’s, genuine alternatives and cosmetic adjustments.  EFA will visually situate the reader in the grand narrative.
- Data Visualisation & Infographics
  collapsed:: true
	- Making complex data digestible and memorable, collated into one accessible location that makes greater sense of it.
