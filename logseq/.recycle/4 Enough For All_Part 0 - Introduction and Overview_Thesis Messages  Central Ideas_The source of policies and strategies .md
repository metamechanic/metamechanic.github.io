The source of policies and strategies 

All resource management methods, all science and technology policy, as is the case with all our systems, strategy, practices and policy…are based on a set of ideas and philosophies.


 Currently, and as has been the case for virtually all recorded human history, that idea has been   “I am not enough.


 I, you, we can decide that yes, there is enough, and consequently create policy that demonstrates, re-inforces and multiplies this.


 Ultimately, they all boil down to one idea from which all policy arises.
