Why?
Energy problems are universal and their consequences massive.
Current solutions are inadequate. Current thinking is largely ineffectual.
Current energy futures thinking is rather shallow: forecasts & mathematical modelling, scenario-making for strategic competitive advantage etc.
Innovative, creative thinking is needed (and not just innovative gadgets.)
Existing energy proposals donâ€™t address such factors as the competition between visions or the inner development required to effect enduring change.
