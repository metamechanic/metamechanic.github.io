Have you ever wondered about poverty Have you ever wondered why there isn’t enough for some people or even for yourself Have you ever wondered why the proposed solutions – economic, political, technological and otherwise – haven’t seemed to work I have. That’s how this book came about. 
I wanted to satisfy a curiosity and perhaps gain some insight into the universal, persistent problem of scarcity. I looked around and saw plenty people starving, mainly in the news as I live in a very wealthy country, Australia. I saw material poverty, famine, conflicts, torture and plenty of other tragedies. Yet I looked around Australia, where such events are much, much less apparent and saw plenty of depression, domestic violence, shootings, arguments, suicide, rape, drugs, fraud and plenty of other sadness. Poverty is everywhere. Peace is not common.

What is EFA EFA is…  An attempt to provide some insight into the obstinate, persistent, universal issues of poverty.  A multi-level, layered treatment of scarcity and abundance in the world.  A blog culminating in a book “Enough For All”  A resource on poverty data and analysis  An alternative to historically inadequate economic, political and other socio-cultural attempts at answering this question.
