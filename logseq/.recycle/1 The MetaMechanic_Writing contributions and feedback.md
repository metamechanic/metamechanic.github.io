Writing contributions and feedback
Global Effort, Fresh Alternatives and Inner Beginner all require on-going contributions by operational definition. This will be explicated in each website.

Enough For All and MYWOF would be enhanced with input from all-comers.

Suggestions on structure, methods, knowledge sources, theoretical foundations and whatever else are all welcome.
