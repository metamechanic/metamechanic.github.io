- The solutions we imagine to problems depends on our model of world mechanisms
- The solutions we imagine to problems depends on our model of the world’s working. How does the world function? What are the mechanisms of the world? What are the laws and rules?  We will offer solutions dependant upon how we think the world works.    So, in Metamechanics, we seek to understand the various models which attempt to explain the operation and function of the world and universe. That way,   “Levels” of machinery and mechanism  The most useful model is the one which: Includes the most phenomenon Explains and accounts for the most phenomena Recognises its own biases and assumptions most clearly Acknowledges and accounts for other models as well Is transparent and open to the scrutiny of others Is testable, though perhaps not falsifiable
