The pathways presented don’t demand monetary payment of any kind, “certification”, donation, tithing, surrender of possessions, membership fees etc.

As a result of your practice of the principles of the pathway you choose, you may be inspired to buy books, attend lectures, donate to charity, or pay for specialised instruction. However, it is not a pre-requisite or even necessary.

We all have lessons to learn, knowledge to acquire and gifts to give. However the big costs will not be financial; rather, we will have to give up our attachments, judgments, fears, doubts, defences, resistance and prejudice. This will be the price to pay to peace.
