Why do some go hungry, malnourished, impoverished?
Why are some homeless, landless and materially insecure?
Why are some unhappy, unhealthy, unhelpful?

Have you ever asked yourself these questions?
Have you ever wondered if there is more to the story than the answers you are given?

Enough For All seeks to address these questions and tell the story of sufficiency by starting with the basics, visualising the data, and using ‘warm logic’.
