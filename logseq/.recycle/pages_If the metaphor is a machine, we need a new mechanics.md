	The universe as a programmable computer
The brain as a neural network of communication & transportation
Society as a factory, 
The body as pumps, filters, carriers, motors…
Civilisation as construction, 
The economy as production line, lever, signal, market “forces”.
The planet as spaceship, fortress or 
Life as elevator, travelator, simulator, laboratory.

A dominant metaphor is machine: digital, biological, mechanical, economical, psychological, social, cultural. This itself is not the problem. The problem in some cases is the manual. In some cases its the design. In other cases its user error.

Machines can be decommissioned, redesigned, reprogrammed and reassembled. Users can be retrained and upskilled. Systems rewired, bootstrapped  Guidelines and instructions can be rewritten and overwritten. These dynamics are not immutable fixtures, laws of nature, firmaments of history, truths of economics or politics.

 Metamechanics takes “technology” as a guiding metaphor, as well as guiding mechanisms, to approach problems and their solving. It employs the pure principles and lofty aspirations of science as a tool to resolve conflict and crises. To address the world’s issues, one must “get under the hood”, “look down the microscope” and see the inner workings - the complex cogs and gears, connections and constructions
The result? “Machinery” that would force the very redefinition of the word, and a reimagining of the world.

There are inputs and there outputs. Yet the questions are always asked: What is it for? Who is it for? Where and when are the benefits and the biases?
