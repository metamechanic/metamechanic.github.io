- Attempts to hoard and keephave is a misguided attempt to have the Love of God
-
- EFA will show that the attempts to hoard and keep/have is a misguided attempt to “have” the Love of God.
- So, EFA will show that we really want the Love of God but we mistakenly try to get that in other symbols.
- Furthermore, realizing that these pursuits are mistakes in the “search” for the Love of God,”they” will remove the obstacles in their realization that they ARE love, loved, loving… Or at least it will lead them towards a conscious spiritual path.
- So, perhaps by realizing this people will free up the resources for others.
