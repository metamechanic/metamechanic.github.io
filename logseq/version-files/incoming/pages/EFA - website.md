	- Inspired Resource Utilization
	  collapsed:: true
		- Enough For All seeks to identify proposals that address multiple layers of the sufficiency problem.  Perhaps there are already some systems and models out there which can do a better job of generating, supplying and distributing enough for all…  Why are they not in place?  Who says they will, or won’t, work?  EFA will explore the tried and tested, and present some Fresh Alternatives.
	- Have you ever wondered why some don't have enough?
	  collapsed:: true
		- I mean…really wondered?  Is there enough?  [Text boxes - images] ??  Enough stuff…food, water, land, shelter, clothing… Enough technology…energy, money, transport, medicine… Enough intangibles…happiness, health, love, peace…  [Perhaps use slider ‘rating’ bars. Set to 100%]  This was the inspiration for the project. It lead to the question, “Is there actually enough for everyone? That would be interesting to know. And if not, could there be, if we used alternative systems?”
	- Reviewing conventional wisdom
	- Simplifying complexity...just enough, not too much
	  collapsed:: true
		- Reframing the problem in order to see effective solutions.  The answer to complexity is not necessarily greater complexity.
	- Web platform for a deep, data-driven narrative
	  collapsed:: true
		- The base of Enough For All is a novel website piecing disparate data into a coherent narrative. It will allow user-driven plot pathways maintaining global meaning and connection between data and layers. The story structure allows deeper investigation as well as superficial story skimming. Enough For All needs web developers, data scientists, database programmers and content contributors to create this site.
- Community
	- The story of the world requires the world to write it. Country analysts, issue specialists, topic experts all required. Data freaks, infographics geeks, and constructive critiques. We need you. UN, NGOs, EDUs, NPOs, VIPs, NFIs… all have a role to play.
