  Introductory & General Notes 011209
	- (See also BaB)
	- Science is already driven by spirituality: the search for meaning in life; by wonder of life, curiosity; money, and the desire for security, power, fame... all expressions of Life and our life individually.
	- (Q: Why do we do science?)
	- Thesis 1:
	  Science is spirituality driven. That is, it is our innate Godly nature, and all that entails, that causes us to do science.
	- Thesis 2:
	  The fact that “science” may not accept that thesis 1, or limits what “spirituality” is, limits the unfolding of science itself... which in turn limits our spirituality.
	- Why do we do science?
	  How do we do science?
	  What is science?
	- Science is exploration. This in turn becomes creation (technology).
	  	Exploration of our physical world, mental objective world...
	  	Creation then becomes realization of our selves on a next/higher/deeper level
	- “On the need for spiritually driven science, and scientifically-enhanced spirituality”
	- We live within a constricting circle of science and spirituality which transcribes a sphere of limitation. That bubble is crying out to be burst. As we boraden the circle, the sphere expands, expanding our perception of what is, and what is possible.
	- “Our righteousness keeps us blind.”
	- Science is limited by fear, and has always been limited by fear. Alternative ideas cannot be explored for various fears:
	  a)	Fear of persecution by church – excommunication
	  b)	Fear of eceonomic loss and difficulty, from going counter to the mainstream, accepted dogma (The religion of science)
	  c)	Fear that our world will fall apart. Our model by which we understand the world will be overturned and upset, thereby upsetting my own peace and comfort. “IF I don’t understand it, I can’t control it. And if I can’t control it, I won’t survive.”
	  d)	Fear of being lesser, for not knowing
	- “Religion and science: history, method, dialogue” ed W Mark Richards
	  “The knowledge and the power: reflections on the history of science”, Ivan Tolstoy
	  “The end of science”, John Morgan
	  Parallels to Jesus/Buddha vs Jewish high priests/lamas
	- Science only appeared in the 16th century (??) (at least inmodern times). Technology has existed (in terms of tools) for thousands of years. It existed well before “science” came on the scene. (Or did it?) Rephrase: before “science” became a formalized, conscious process... When “technicians” were developing early tools,they fabricated, tested/measured/used observed and improved (re-fabricated). This perhaps happened less consciously and in a less formal manne.
	- So, tech appeared befre science. This approach to tech development has existed long before the “scientific” approach to tech development.
	  So, when coming up with new energy techs that are scientifically “flawed”...we can say that one day science wll catc up to the tech eg. Flight/aviation/space, surgery... scientific understandings should not be a requirement for tech development.
	  “Only in the last two centuries has science had a dramatic impact on technology”
	- There is much bullshit and spurious theories our there about alternative history, conspiracy theory, science theory etc. But there always has, and always will be. Its only by proposign the seemingly insane and whacky that the truth has been arrived at. In that process spurious info and incorrect, dodgy theories are proposed...but they must be proposed for the correct one to be decided upon frm that “selection”
	- Often, and over history, that range of “selections” has been determined by a small group (eg. Clergy, scientific orthodoxy etc) But real progress has been made by breaking those shackles eg. Galileo, Copernicus, Jesus, Buddha
	- But there are barriers to making those theories – the possibly true AND the untrue, spurious, wong – accessible/acceptable to the mindset; barriers to opening the minds of research orthodoxy (and the surrounding supporting political, economic and social machine) to addressing those issues to a greater degree in society, to determine the true from the false.
	- Anthropic principle says something like “the Universe knew we were coming”. Therefore the physical constants and conditions are perfect. “Conditions have to be just right to allow life (which is fragile) and consciousness to evolve”
	- Kaku: “Life and consciousness can only exist in a very narrow band of physical parameters”
	- This is saying that consciousness depends on the physical. Ie that the physical is the basis for all else. TOE’s refer only to physical laws of the Universe.
	- Kaku seems to describe everything in terms of laws of physics eg. Wave functions.
	- “Trillions of years from now, when temperatures are so low...it will be impossible tohave any intelligent being survive.”
	  Intelligent beings won’t be limited by a body affected by “cold” etc
	  Implies that Implies that we are “intelligent”, and that future universe
	  “The wealth of nations depends upon the technology that will replace the power of silicon.”

- Consistency of thinking. (Mis)Alignment of conclusions and operation with premises and assumptions.
  eg. How do the daily lives of scientists and their practice of science agree with the consequences of quantum mechanics?
  Spiritual foundation of all activity
  Identifying new patterns through reframing, problematizing, re-advocating
  Rescue from New Age and Atheism. Recontextualise.
  Universal Principles
  Science, Ethics & Resource Allocation
  Why pursue certain directions of research and development over others?
  Why prioritise resource allocation in one direction when there could be other  pathways better invested?
  Technological research/development choices represent value choices
  Where should we go? This path or that path?
  Who is deciding?
  Who benefits?
  What pathways are sacrificed?
  What economic system does the technology support and promote?
  What social system (socio-economic system) does the technology promote?
  On what models of understanding are decisions made/based?
  Some pathways are rejected, even though they are clear and safe.
  AI, social media, personal big data
  Socio-techno-economic systems as expressions of collective unconscious value systems
