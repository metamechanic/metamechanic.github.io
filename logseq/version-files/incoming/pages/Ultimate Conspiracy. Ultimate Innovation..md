title:: Ultimate Conspiracy. Ultimate Innovation.

- #QTS : How does #TUC relate to #[[Ultimate Conspiracy. Ultimate Innovation.]] ?
	- Are they 2 sides of the same coin?
	- Probably, yes.
		- You can't just say "this is problem" without offering an alternative, a solution, a way out. This could be framed in terms of innovation
	- A novel, innovative way to relate to unusual concepts: conspiracy (and subsequent victimhood) to innovation and novel thinking.

- Premise
- Key Messages
- Audience
- Skeleton outline
	- Part A - The Ultimate Conspiracy
	  The problem. The nature of problems. The meta-problem.
		- the world as a conspiracy by us against ourselves
		- we unconsciously sabotage our own prosperity and health
		- unconscious guilt is the source of the actions against innovation and insight eg. cancer cures, free energy, universal abundance
			- here we meet EFA!
	- Part B - The Ultimate Innovation
	  The nature of solutions. Hierarchy of illusions. Beyond illusions.
		- The only way to achieve MDG’s is through a fundamental shift in consciousness/perception. “Consciousness” here = concepts of “spirituality” or “life/world model”.
		- Current thinking has created the problems. Current thinking won’t fix the problem. Current approaches to fixing problem won’t work.
		- Why/how were the current problems created?
		- What are the current methods of solving our problems?
		  (problems at a large scale, global & regional levels, as well as personal)
		- What is our current thinking? (wrt science & our spiritual heritage). What general trends, patterns and characteristics can be observed?
		- How do our beliefs manifest through trends over time – patterns that change their faces over time but don’t change the underlying belief structure? (ie. Demonstrating our consciousness hasn’t really changed.)
		- What are the examples/cases where consciousness has radically shifted, quite rapidly (on a large-ish scale?)

- Our fear of ignorance holds us in ignorance.
- Intuition, and the need for each person to have their inner guidance; in an age of information overload.
- Examples of where shifts/developments/growths in our spirituality have led to breakthroughs in science in the past?? (spirituality = broader world view, enhanced/expanded life view)
- A treatise on expanded thinking.
	- Multi-tiered, umbrella-like.
	- DeBono (and others) and lateral, creative thinking
	- Current, standard, mainstream innovation thinking strategies
	- Accelerated Learning folk eg. Wim Wenger
	- Ultimately, INSPIRED innovation. Guided by Holy Spirit. Replacing fear with love.
