- Situating everything in a more helpful, meaningful way or "location" in a bigger, better model. For example:
  collapsed:: true
	- Science
		- does not acknowledge or account for psi, paranormal
		- spirit, spirituality
		- has religion-like qualities
		- plays God
		- doesn't account for UFO's, ET's in a comprehensive way
	- Religion
		- plenty of shortcomings but still very useful
		- full of inconsistencies, but which can be resolved
	- History
		- built on "up from Eden" model
		- linear, or linear under-model
			- eg historical cycles but still with 2024 AD as the pinnacle
		- does not account for advanced ancient civilizations
		- does not account for possible Earth colonization eg. via Mars
	- Evolution
		- does not account for advanced ancient civilizations
		-
- Asking the questions:
	- How can these (the above) be better?
		- How can they be made better?
		- How can they be viewed better?
	- How are they inadequate, contradictory, hypocritical, unhelpful, self-contradictory?
	- How can they fit together, to be coherent?
	- How do we reconcile God, science, religion, UFOs, psi, myth, ancient civilizations, alternative medicine...in a meaningful, robust way.
	- How much do real #T.O.E theorists acknowledge the alternative? eg. ETs, Atlantis
	- How to introduce these ideas to the general public?
