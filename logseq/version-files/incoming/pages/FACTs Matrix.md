- #DiaGnosis
- Place fringe, alternative and conspiracy theories on axes to compare and contrast them
-
- Possible axes
	- Degree of Agreement with orthodoxy; consensus
		- ie. what are conspiracies that everyone agrees on? (that occurred in the past)
		- what are fringe theories that were unorthodox that became orthodox
	- Time
	- % truth or accuracy in theory
		- Moon landings
			- Did all trips land on the moon?
			- Did only the published trips go to the moon? Were there more, unpublished trips?
- This ties in with the idea of a #[[fresh alternative]]
