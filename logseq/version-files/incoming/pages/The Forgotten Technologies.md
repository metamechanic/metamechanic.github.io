- The Forgotten Technologies -  General Notes 011209
	- Incorporates the idea of  “Truth Tools”
	- Fundamental underlying question: “What is our intention?” This determines use and efficacy of tech.
	- “Spirituality” = meaning of/in our lives
	  = meaning of Life
	  = view of the bigger/biggest picture.
	  “Spirituality”  = our idea(s) of our Self, what Life and the Universe is for.
	- Every sphere of activity reflects our ideas about ourselves.
	- Science in support of our enhanced concept of spirituality
	  Spirituality driven science
	  (A feedback loop)
	- Science
	  Religion
	  Time
	  The body
	  Money
	  Weather
	  Food
	  Sex
	  Work
	  ...
	- Two levels/types of forgotten tech (very much like FRESH and its levels of alternatives.)
	  1.	Worldly systems and technologies. (There are worldly alternatives and better ways of doing things eg. Alternative economies, medicine, energy, weather engineering etc.)
	  2.	Spiritual technologies. (Everything is a tool for peace/truth/love/self-realization etc. God sends nothing but angels.)
	- Thus, 2 Parts to the book.
	- Comments on “Spiritual Technologies”
	  a)	Not a-la Ray Kurzweil and the age of spiritual machines
	  b)	A recontextualization of conspiracy, suppressed science buffs and alternative health advocates a-la Nexus who quote Goji berries, UFO’s, The anastasis series or any kind of form, as the answer to life. (A balance to them. Putting them in their better place & role.)
	- Define “technology”. (Conventional. Machines. Tools. Software.)
	  Part 1 deals with worldly tech. Energy. Medicine.
	  Redefine “technology” (Ideas, philosophies)
	  Part 2 deals with (say) economic systems, money, the body, religion, language, integral
	  Redefine “technology” again. (Spiritual, non-dual)
	  Part 3 deals with Life. Time. Every illusion – food, sex, relationships. Put everything into the context of Form vs Content, Illusion vs Reality, Love vs Fear, Forgiveness vs Attack/Defence.
	- Science as Technology. (Ironic no?)
	  Science as a tool for discovery of the cosmos and the Kosmos.
	- Mind as Technology.
	  The mind can be a tool of Spirit, or it can be a tool of the ego.
	- LIFE as Technology.
	  Human life is a tool, for purposes.
	  God’s tools vs human tools.
	- life as Technology.
	  Nanotech, Organic Machines, Self-Assembly, Biomimicry
	  “Engines of Creation” – Eric Drexler, father of nanotech.
	- Religion as Technology.
	  Check definition of “religion” in US IRS literature.
	  Check Dennett, Hitchens, Dawkins etc
	  Babies and Bathwater.
	- Time as Technology.
	  What is time used for? What will I use it for?
	  All traditions speak of a “Heaven” of sorts. That Heaven must exist now. So where is it?Is not Time now for the “getting to” Heaven? And everything within that Time is FOR the return of Heaven.
	- The Body as Technology.
	  Look at our physical body as “God’s Technology”. That is, our physical bodies (& even perhaps our emotional bodies, mental...etc) are tools designed by X (God, devil, “seven source templates”, whatever.) Therefore, we can look at our bodies as tools/tech that we can then modify (to varying degrees, depths + levels). In fact, we already do!! (cosmetic surgery, ge, radiation, our actual choice of partner.)
	  “The Future of the Body”, Michael Murphy. Exhaustive catalogue of bodily + mental powers enabled through sport or spiritual practice, or natural endowment.
	- Money as Technology.
	  A tool to enable...X. X is our choice. Money (&financial systems), not some unknown and unknowable mechanism/organism. It is tech that we, as a society, over time, created, modified & adopted. It is not “a given”, at whose mercy we are under. It is our slave. We should not be its.
	- Weather as “Technology”
	- We need a well-equipped toolbox – a variety of tools, not too few, not too many, and knowing the usefulness of each.
	- Tools for Truth.
	  Tools for growth, discovery, exploration, creation, expansion, abundance promotion, love promotion.
	  Or do we make them tools for separation, destruction, alientation, ostricization, fear promotion...???  and like with any technology, it is not the technology which determines the outcome but the ideas, attitudes, beliefs of those who use the technology.
	- Need a chapter/section summarizing all of the previous/above and stating and re-stating the general thesis:
	  That ALL is God’s technology. God sends nothing but angels. We just need to choose what we use it for: Love vs Fear. What is our intention? Expand to include everything else.
