- #RRW #[[Metamechanic Mycelium]] #TLDR
- Tag heavily
	- update [[Metamechanic ontology]] routinely
- Write pages as short blocks then 'page embed' or 'block embed' so I can fold them
- Don't make pages too long
- Where is the length limit?
	- Single bullet point/node like Tana is too short
	- Long-form (like Obsidian) is not the style I'm after
- Ask myself at each point: what is the smallest block that will make sense by itself?
- Answer questions
	- Have a clear research question and sub-questions for each task
	- Write to these questions
