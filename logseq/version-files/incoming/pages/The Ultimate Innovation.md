- The Ultimate Innovation (TUI)
  Introductory & General Notes
	- The only way to achieve MDG’s is through a fundamental shift in consciousness/perception. “Consciousness” here = concepts of “spirituality” or “life/world model”.
	- Current thinking has created the problems. Current thinking won’t fix the problem. Current approaches to fixing problem won’t work.
	- Why/how were the current problems created?
	  What are the current methods of solving our problems?
	  (problems at a large scale, global & regional levels, as well as personal)
	  What is our current thinking? (wrt science & our spiritual heritage). What general trends, patterns and characteristics can be observed?
	  How do our beliefs manifest through trends over time – patterns that change their faces over time but don’t change the underlying belief structure? (ie. Demonstrating our consciousness hasn’t really changed.)
	  What are the examples/cases where consciousness has radically shifted, quite rapidly (on a large-ish scale?)
	- Our fear of ignorance holds us in ignorance.
	- Intuition, and the need for each person to have their inner guidance; in an age of information overload.
	- Examples of where shifts/developments/growths in our spirituality have led to breakthroughs in science in the past?? (spirituality = broader world view, enhanced/expanded life view)
