- Information mapping tool
- I want a tool that:
- Accepts a nugget of information
- Holds it
- Records related data of it
- eg. organization, person, ideology, knowledge arena, geography, chronology,
- (The database has various fields eg
- [Myth A] may also belong to another typology, organization, domain etc.
- I need an ontology !!
- Every artefact has differing hierarchical chain of entities.
- That is, what data selections become available from "Futures" is different from what becomes available from "Organization"
-
- You could start entering data from any property.
- (ie. You might recognize there is a "myth" or a "scenario" to work with.
-
- Data artefact type:
- Organization
- Individual
- Technology (hard)
- Concept (soft)
- Future
- Practice (is this a concept)
- Tool
-
- Dynamic database and mapping
- You have a particular idea
-
- It represents a worldview, a future, a philosophy...whether it is explicit or implicit.
-
- Data has attributes and can be categorized.
- The attributes and categories may be over-lapping.
- Mapping frameworks can be applied to the data
- The data can be visualized differently using the different frameworks.
-
- Eg. Geography.
- The location of nations can be mapped using latitude and longitude.
- They can also be classifed by eg.
- HDI
- Religious groups
- Statistical measurements eg. population,
- Types of government
-
-
- Additional cartographies can be added to the data in time, as they are invented or discovered.
- The data management tools must be able to adapt to this.
-
- The map can then be visualized.
- The map is created by designating the particular attributes to map.
- The data (organizations/individuals, ideas, objects...) will be situated differently according to different mapping schema.
-
- Information visualization is not enough. It often has a mapping schema implicit, BUT NOT EXPOSED.
- The idea of knowledge/futures mapping is to EXPOSE, CHANGE and PROBLEMATIZE the mapping schema.
- The purpose is to RECONTEXTUALIZE the information/data
- The purpose is to draw new maps.
-
- If we have a map, which in our linear minds has a start and a finish (a past, present, future) and that finish is not questioned...we don't have an alternative route.
- If we can draw new maps, with missing or heretofore undiscovered or uncreated "finishes" futures, then
-
- Relate MAPS with PURPOSE and DIRECTION.
- Where are we coming from? Where are we going to? And why?
-
- Maps are used so we can get from A to B.
- Maps are used so we can get an idea of the terrain (topography) - a localised 3-D map
- Maps are used to avoid dangers/pitfalls and navigate to safety.
- Maps are used to know what is out there.
- Maps are used to go to places when we need resources.

- Power plays map
- Power plays map
-
- A visual knowledge map showing attributions and allocations of authority.
-
- I suspect there are only a few fundamental archetypal maps.
-
- The lower level actors, agents and authorities may differ but then you eventually arrive at the usual suspects:
  -- religion,
  -- god,
  -- the body/senses,
  -- "rights",
- * UN declaration of rights
- * historical rights
- * "innate" rights
- *
  -- empirical science
  -- common sense
  -- collective "intelligence"
  -- unquestioned tradition
  -- What are the driving questions to ask in order to unearth and divine and clarify the power and authority relationships?
-
- The alternative response to arbitrary power relationships and structures is metaphysics/ meta-mechanics. Instead of 'just saying' or pointing to human- or world made documents, we can rely on metaphysical principles and true cause-effect laws. Use of These principles will affirm and amplify human ideals and ideas.
-
- In fact, they already do. Our current power structures, as well as all systems, reflect our idea of ourselves. That can be Magnitude, or it can be littleness.
-
- We use mistaken meta mechanics.  Or, alternatively said, we misuse metaphysics for mistaken ends.
-
- Full-circle?
- We may end up illuminating the chicken-egg full circle thinking of power and responsibility.
- It all depends on the premise one begins with.

- Outline & Map writing
- From the outset readers can see the structure.
-
- Basically, in a time constrained world, I need to communicate to readers why they should read the following. I need to grab attention. I need to summarise and communicate the gist.
-
- Chapters (on left hand side) -> Brief description on the right hand side
- Questions on left, answers on right ?
-
- Summaries can be in a question format?
- Or a statement format?
- The statement answers the question. But do I/readers know why the statement is important?
-
- Columns
- Questions on left. Statements on right.
-
- Outlines??
- Outlines can be both
- An outline of questions
- An outline of statement-answer-responses
-
- But questions arise as a result of statements...
-
- There are questions that belong within parent questions
- There are questions that are sibling questions
-
- Difference between web and print
- Doesn't work for single plot fiction
- Does/could work for non-fiction (in my style)

- Why knowledge mapping tool?!
-
- I would like to know a lot.
- I would like to know how knowledge fits together, how it's related.
- I would like to know what knowledge nuggets are actually important and helpful versus what is seemingly different, or superficially different, but essentially the same.
-
- Need an ontology!!
- Relationships, structures etc...
- Tinderbox as my knowledge and futures mapping tool
- I will collate:
- thinkers
- organisations
- visions
- drivers
- ....and whatever else. I don't know what!
-
- So i need a flexible tool which will evolve with the information.
-
- I don't want to pre-impose structures on the information in advance, or a particular heirarchy of organization.
