- Summary / Intro of Inner Beginner?
  collapsed:: true
	- Inner Beginner is a manual for those seeking greater meaning, peace and joy in their lives.
	  Inner Beginner is a guide for those on, or about to embark on, the journey within but who may have reservations and misgivings about spiritual practice.
	- Inner Beginner is a simple introductory text on applied metaphysics, offering a model of God-Universe-Space-Time Organization (GUSTO) that allows for peace in a world of suffering and separation.
	- Inner Beginner is a clearinghouse of some alternative and lesser known spiritual practices that offer depth, rigour and example.
	- Inner Beginner is a clarification and discussion of misconceptions and myths around God, church, religious texts and teachings for seekers of peace and healing.
	- In an era of unprecedented material affluence and advanced technology, incredible misery and suffering persists. This pain is evident not only in the lives of many of the materially impoverished and those witness to war, violence and catastrophe. The struggle, strain and stress resides in the hearts and minds of all of us. Globalized telecommunications and media make this agony all the more apparent and accessible.
	- Many people are seeking to make sense of their lives and the world in the face of this suffering. Many more people are seeking meaning and value where the accelerating appearance of new technology is failing. Many more people are beginning to look within for some calm amidst the storm.
	- Yet many people are discouraged or delayed from spiritual practice by the incongruence of many existing religious and spiritual paths. Traditional religion has let many people down. New Atheism may be an advancement but may leave you uninspired and unsatisfied with its lack of imagination and self-awareness. The New Age embraces scientific developments but may suffer from a lack of depth, rigour and example. What to do then?
	- Don’t give up. There are alternatives. God, peace, joy and happiness are not dead, despite the best efforts of many to kill It, or at least make It boring and painful. All spiritual ideas and anti-ideas still hold immense value despite criticisms and failures. Yet this book will try to help you make some sense of them. This guide aims to heal our misguided ideas about Spirit, the spiritual path and spiritual practice.
	- This is not a book on comparative religion. The aim is not to remain in the realm of theory, academia or curiosity. Rather we hope to delve into the depths of experience. For this, a map that inspires is required, as is a system of practice to traverse the territory. Inner Beginner offers an outline of the first and many lesser known options for the second that may prove more satisfying and rigorous.
	- The ideas in this book may not be new to you. Their aggregation, and philosophical consequences of this, may be new, and may be challenging. Yet in challenge lies reward.

	- Serve as a referral point for EFA, Fresh, MetaMechanics, TremenDuus,
	- AMT needs to be developed in parallel, or even before; Inner Beginner refers to it as a position statement
		- or I just state my position, using ACIM quote: [[a universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is necessary]], reinforcing that multiple paths are possible
		- the goal is not the path/tool; its the End which is the goal
	- Differentiation and overlap of Inner Beginner & AMT
	  How do they complement? How/where do they differ?
		- Do the principles, misconceptions and corrections of AMT need to be pushed or prioritised in Inner Beginner?
	- Where is your source of power? From what do you derive meaning and happiness? What guides you in your decision making?  Are they sustainable? Readily accessible? Effective? Wise?

	- Does religion seem outdated, inconsistent, unhelpful or wrong?

- About Inner Beginner; Origins & Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- Purpose of Inner Beginner - What for?
		- An interactive online community and resource
		- An aid to the novice spiritual aspirant
		- A presentation of some lesser-known, alternative yet effective spiritual tools
		- An alternative to:
			- unimaginative, sterile “atheists”
			- dogmatic, literal fundamentalists
			- the new-age spiritual buffet
			- An advertisement for forgiveness, compassion and kindness as the simultaneous basis of personal fulfillment and more effective worldly operation.
		-
		- Inner Beginner intends to introduce ideas and views which may help make sense of traditional religious systems and practices, and rediscover their utility and truth.
		- Inner Beginner is a clearinghouse of some alternative and lesser known spiritual practices that offer depth, rigour and example.
		- Inner Beginner is a clarification and discussion of misconceptions and myths around God, church, religious texts and teachings for seekers of peace and healing.
		- Inner Beginner is a starting point and map store for those seeking greater meaning, peace and joy in their lives.
		- Sooner or later we all reach a point where the usual external phenomena cease to lose their ability to satisfy and/or become unavailable. Money, fashion, drugs, sex, food, “power”, approval, bodily pleasure…all become somewhat empty or fruitless at some point. Inner Beginner seeks to present some pathways which don’t deny these worldly customs and necessities, but reframe them for helpful, healthy, harmonious ends.

	- [[Rationale for Inner Beginner]] - Why?

		- There are people calling out for more substantial and effective spiritual tools than atheism, mainstream religion or fundamentalism. This may help those seekers begin their journey.
		- In an era of unprecedented material affluence and advanced technology, incredible misery and suffering persists. This pain is evident not only in the lives of many of the materially impoverished and those witness to war, violence and catastrophe.
		- Meditation, compassion and kindness has proven benefits, in many ways and forms.
		- We’re all seeking for the same thing and we’re seeking that outside ourselves. The nightly news, amongst other things, shows this strategy is not working.
		- Don’t give up. There are alternatives.
		- The conversation around spirituality has been dumbed down. Alternatives do exist but don’t get a good voice.

- [[Criteria and Features of Spiritual Tools included in Inner Beginner]]
  collapsed:: true
	- Points on Included Teachings
	- Free. Freedom.
		- The pathways presented don’t demand monetary payment of any kind, “certification”, donation, tithing, surrender of possessions, membership fees etc.  As a result of your practice of the principles of the pathway you choose, you may be inspired to buy books, attend lectures, donate to charity, or pay for specialised instruction. However, it is not a pre-requisite or even necessary.  We all have lessons to learn, knowledge to acquire and gifts to give. However the big costs will not be financial; rather, we will have to give up our attachments, judgments, fears, doubts, defences, resistance and prejudice. This will be the "price" to pay to peace.

- Position Statement and Philosophy [[Overarching Position Statement and Philosophy of Inner Beginner]]
  collapsed:: true
	- In a modern age of Science...
		- Science has overturned many historical religious claims and promoted questioning, inquiry, rights and empirical experience.
		- Science has glimpsed modern analogues to metaphysical phenomena mentioned in ancient spiritual texts
		- Science has not offered adequate responses, for many, around fundamental issues such as meaning, purpose, origins, ethics and love.
		- So... science-like rigour need, and can, be applied to our inner worlds to explain, fulfill and guide us better.
	- In a world replete with religion...
