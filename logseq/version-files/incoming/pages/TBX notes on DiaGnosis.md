- Barriers to Knowledge Action Accessibility
- Consuming data Digesting information Extracting knowledge  (and excreting intellectual waste) (And storing intellectual surplus) Acting on wisdom  Data and information is useless unless it leads to…  Understanding Action  Furthermore, understanding must lead to greater and deeper understanding. Action must become more and more effective.  Greater understanding is correlated to deeper peace, joy, purpose and inspiration. Action is measured by prosperity
