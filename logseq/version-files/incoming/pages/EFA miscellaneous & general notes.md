- “Enough” = generating more/acquiring more + requiring less/relying on less
- Some things we can create more of. Other things are finite. Eg. Land, water
- Trying to look for abundnce in finite resources is misguided madness. The finite is, by definition, limited and scarce. Material resources are finite. Therefore, abundance is only really found in the Infinite.
	- This can be said for food,
	- "...looking for abundance in the limited..." is a better phrasing
- Question: “What is Infinite?” Answer: Ideas are Infinite. Mind is Infinite. God is the Infinite Idea.
- We misuse resources and create insufficiency by misidentifying/misdirecting our source of power and abundance. “Looking for love in all the wrong places” We’re trying to satisfy the Infinite through the finite.
- Note on minimum requirements and standards for living
	- I cannot set the minimums. I can merely show what is possible, currently available, previously available etc.
- Is there actually enough for all? I am starting to wonder... What if waste is not of a quantity sufficient enough to cover the lack? Then we have to redirect resources, use resources more efficiently and alter lifestyles.
- The premise/thesis of EFA is that excess and inefficient and inappropriate resource usage is a result of looking in the wrong place (ie. To that particular resource) for salvation, satisfaction, fulfilment.
- Maslow’s assertion: “Self-actualization” happens only after fulfilment of other tiers. It represents the path generally taken by humans. But is it really back to front?
- EFA may not provide solutions directly, but it does identify the problem. By not providing too many solutions, it opens up for suggestions  While there is a belief in lack and scarcity, there will be power struggles to control the seeming source of life.
- Current economic systems don’t address (or even acknowledge):
	- The idea there is a belief in lack
	- The location of the lack
	- The way to remedy the lack (it simply moves the lack around in time and place)
	- In fact, current economic systems rely on lack for their operation. It is a building block.
- All poverty is power poverty: physical power, authority, metaphysical
- Solutions sections
- Discuss macro-solution principles (a lead-in to universal principles, macroenergetics)
- State summarily the problem resolution approach ie. Reverse of part 1
- Form v Content
- Integral
- [[CLA]]
- [[PROUT]]
- [[Currency Exchange Tax]] (a specific example)
- Discuss some specific attempts
- Confusion of Problem with Symptoms
	- Currently problems are seen to be Overpopulation Biodiversity loss, ecological degradation Climate change etc However, these are actually symptoms. They are symptoms of separation.
- Warning to Self. I must make it clear that this is not a case of pray to God to make it rain, make my child better, make my side win... as is so often done.
- Q: How does “going to God”, “seeking God first”, “listening to God”... manifest in planning, strategy, organizing, designing, individual life etc.
- A: Listening to others Inspiration, inspired creativity
- Not re-inforcing the prob or creating a new one
- Encouragement (&ability) of debate without attachment
- Fearlessness
- Expanded idea of oneself
- No over-consumption – obesity, material goods, drugs, addiction
- ignore or devalue significant dimensions of experience and being, prioritising their own lenses and fields of competence.  or follow assumptions or premises which
- Many approaches lay fault 'out there', in _these_ people, _that_ group or _those_ conditions. That may be true to a degree but we also have a locus of control and a responsibility of interpretation.
- Alternatively, solutions are limited to these special parties and require 'subscription' to be saved.
- EFA hopes to create:
	- A caring, concerted, capable community
	- An independent, sustainable organisation
	- Yes, we have an agenda. May we stay true to that as we collaborate with like-minded organisations and individuals, in the face of competing and conflicting messages.
	- Insight. Illumination. Information.
	- Simple, coherent, engaging, uplifting message
