	- In [Inca mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_mythology), **Unu Pachakuti** is the name of a [flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood) that [Viracocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viracocha) caused to destroy the people around [Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake) [Titicaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titicaca), saving two to bring civilization to the rest of the world.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unu_Pachakuti#cite_note-1)
	- The process of destruction is linked with a new construction. It has a very deep meaning in the language and traditions. Some people would translate it as "revolution".
	- "The Inca’s supreme being and creator god, Con Tici (Kon Tiki) Viracocha, first created a race of giants, but they were unruly, so he destroyed them in a mighty flood and turned them to stone. Following the deluge, he created human beings from smaller stones. "In other versions of this story, the impious race is the pre-Inca civilization of the Tiahuanaco Americans about Lake Titicaca, the large high lake in the Andes. Viracocha drowns them and spares two, a man and a woman, to start the human race anew. Some versions of the Unu Pachakuti have the surviving man and woman floating to Lake Titicaca in a wooden box."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unu_Pachakuti#cite_note-2)
