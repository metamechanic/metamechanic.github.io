- Science is limited by fear, and has always been limited by fear. Alternative ideas cannot be explored for various fears:
	- a)	Fear of persecution by church – excommunication
	- b)	Fear of economic loss and difficulty, from going counter to the mainstream, accepted dogma (The religion of science)
	- c)	Fear that our world will fall apart. Our model by which we understand the world will be overturned and upset, thereby upsetting my own peace and comfort. “IF I don’t understand it, I can’t control it. And if I can’t control it, I won’t survive.”
	- d)	Fear of being lesser, for not knowing
- What are the various [[Schools of Scientific Thinking]]
- the world is illusion
- scientific models are all metaphors
- models (and thus metaphors) change, expand, abstractionize
-
- The failure to return to foundational assumptions and premises when outcomes are anomalous. (What does this fall under? - unScience? aScience?)

	- There is an objective reality
	- (only) apprehensible through the five senses and their extensions
- Collective subjectivity vs individual objectivity
-
- Incongruence in orthodox science
	- [[Terence McKenna]]: "Science asks for just one miracle."
	- Comedian skit about "nothing"
- Ridicule, rage, resentment and rip-offs in science
	- "But scientists are only human!"
	- "rip offs" refers to theft and unacknowledgment and mischaracterization
		- [[Rosalind Franklin]]
	- The problem with scientists is that they are human.
