  Intro & Gen Notes
	- We are drawn up/along, rather than pushed from “below” to higher/greater/ “next” sources (source attractors). This is natural. At the same time, we are held back, pulled back, pushed down... by our attractors and agreements with “lower”/ “lesser” sources.
	- So, we are of greatest service by
	  a)	Raising our own consciousness / source attractor
	  i.	That we are attracted to
	  ii.	That we “emit”
	  b)	Minimizing our negative impact on others. Replacing negative impact with positive impact.
	- We dissolve the “magnetism” of lesser attractors through invocation & injection of aspects of higher attractors eg. Love, acceptance, surrender, joy, reason etc.
	- Connect/correlate/tie technology to stages of consciousness.
	  Ie. Wilber, Chopra et al derive stages correlating to their “worldview”, “God-relationship” etc
	  Maybe I can specify this to technology.
	  Ie. Does technology embody certain worldviews and God-views?
	  Is it that the certain use of technology demonstrates certain worldview principles eg. Fission
	- Of course the application of the tech demonstrates certain world-view ie. Sword used to attack, kill, to usurp OR to defend, protect, nurture etc.
	  But, does the (say) operating principles of the technology embody certain world-views?
	  Eg. Taking from environment/domination, without care, without “giving back”
	  Vs say, pure 100% recycling of resources freely.
	  Centralized vs decentralized
- Expanded ecological thermodynamics. Holistic energy as a universal indicator and currency
