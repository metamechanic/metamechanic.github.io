alias:: circular thinking
- If you feel like you haven't come full circle, you haven't either
	- identified the assumptions prior to your starting point
	- don't consider the starting point
- In other words: We always prove ourselves right.
- What is the purpose of your thinking?
- Most of the circle is unconscious, under the surface of awareness. This is by design.
