- There are a number of reasons EFA exists as a web-based exploration of enough, as well as for the format and mechanisms employed.
	- See also: [[Purpose, Aims & Objectives of EFA]]
- Personal curiosity around the driving questions.
	- I, (Adam Duus), the instigator of this exercise, am personally curious about the over-arching idea(s) and [driving questions]([[Driving Questions of EFA]]), as well as many of the sector-specific questions that arise. These questions around enough vary from things like:
		- Is there enough money to pay all debt? If not, why not? How is money 'made'? What is it with respect to debt? If governments globally owe a net sum, to whom do they owe?
		- Are there enough rare earth metals and other materials to build the large-scale renewable energy systems proposed by some parties?
		- How do some mystics and sages experience abundant inner peace while living an outwardly simple, frugal, limited, even ascetic lifestyle?
		- Is there already enough evidence to substantially demonstrate the existence of extra-terrestrials despite orthodox arguments to the contrary. Do our cosmological considerations distract from more pressing concerns?
		- What could be achieved if all military funding, and the proceeds of war, waste and corruption could be redirected? What are the obstacles to this naive pipedream?
		-
	- This enterprise began from personal curiosity of the me, the founder, Adam Duus. In a particular period of my life, moments of feeling personally inadequate, and materially under-resourced in Australia, I also looked further afield to see
		- No formal background or conventional training in economics, geopolitics, psychology, philosophy or the disciplines that traditionally treat such questions.
		- I'm hoping my naivety, in conjunction with a hope for some academic rigour, along with some like-minded collaborators, may
		- What's the difference, and why, between the mega-wealthy yet unfulfilled celebrity or business person, and the materially modest, even
		- Do entities (individuals, groups, nation-states) perpetuate states of poverty through their own decision? Are states of abundance largely a result of good fortune?
	- These are some big questions; perhaps even the biggest of questions. What can be more worthwhile pursuing?
- Leverage and efficacy of social contribution
  collapsed:: true
	- Most people want to help someone in some way. However, charity and activism may not always be enough, may compound the problem, and/or may actually be self-serving. And how effective is (my) charity and activism? Are there better ways to channel resources? Better attitudes towards these practices? Are there particularly powerful pressure points where my resources could be better directed?
- Combat hopelessness, powerlessness and apathy.
  collapsed:: true
	- These themselves symbolise a sense of scarcity - a common response in the face of overwhelming, grave, complex issues. A purpose of EFA is to alleviate this by identifying points of powerful decision and frameworks of understanding.
- Universality. No one does not lack something. EFA may help.
  collapsed:: true
	- This project may help heal my own personal senses of poverty through understanding and action, and therefore may serve a similar role for others.
	- Much of the modern, industrial malaise is a sense of meaninglessness, despair and depression in an age of unprecedented material wealth. This is while a large portion of the world experiences basic resource poverty and counterproductive conflict.
	- There is a need to inter-relate (in)sufficiency of all types, at all levels, in all dimensions across all sectors to address all forms of poverty, inner and outer.
- “Market need.”
  collapsed:: true
	- No one single forum (to the best of my knowledge) unites and integrates discussion around sufficiency, at all levels, in all dimensions, in a convenient, digestible manner. There is no place an educated layperson can go for a synopsis of sufficiency made sensible through story, where they can also get more detail and generate further curiosity.
- Dissatisfaction with many common views on the matter.
  collapsed:: true
	- Most solutions seem to only hit part of the problem. They miss this issue, that aspect, those exceptions, or that other dimension of experience. Many explanations ignore or devalue certain dimensions of experience, reducing them to "by-products" or downstream effects of their area of expertise. EFA posits that the problems of the depressed millionaire drug-addict share similarities and linkages to nation-states below the poverty line and everything in between.
	- Experts disagree with each other. Experts are shown to be wrong. But why? What are they saying? What did they miss? Starting from the ground up, we'll present and consider the data systematically.
	- Experts disagree within themselves. Translated: there are many unhappy professors, policy-makers and pundits. Their solutions have a limited range of applicability and may not address their own sense of scarcity. This does not mean to ignore their brilliant insights but situate them into the grand story.
- Response to the hypotheses and intuitions
	- Common approaches to solutions may be back-to-front, upside-down and inside-out. Alternatively, they consider limited levels or aspects of experience while individuals and organisations all seek wholeness. EFA aims to address this and promote ideas that support this.

- Decomplexification, definition, distillation and digestibility
	-
	- Overwhelming issues made visible, manageable and hopeful.
		-
		- Complexity covers poverty and disguises solutions
			- Using graphic tools, logic, web technology and knowledge mapping
			- A layered, global analysis of sufficiency integrated into an understandable and meaningful story
		- Most of us feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and hopeless when we look at the scale of suffering and conflict. Many of us choose not to look for this reason.  Enough For All seeks to not only present data in a way that is digestible, but offer hope and mechanisms for alleviating suffering, resolving conflict and addressing poverties and inequalities.
		- Disconnection, incoherence
		- Depression and despair turned into a new direction
		  Depressing data into a message of hope and power
	- The story of the world, simplified and visualised
		- The story of the world is the story of “more”. Money, power, security, food, control, time…and the search never ends. Much data on this already exists. Its a question of making sense of it.  Enough For All presents the data visually, drawing simple conclusions with logical consequences and deduction. The result:  a labyrinth of scarcity translated into an epic of enoughness.
- Spiritual practice
  collapsed:: true
	- I suspect my own fulfillment is linked to filling the bellies, pockets, hearts, minds and souls of as many as possible. I suspect the process may help uncover and illuminate my own resistance to enough: in myself, and for others. I also suspect I may not be alone in this.
	- I don't expect to solve the problem, nor get anywhere near. I do hope, however, to point the way towards more rigorous, fulfilling pathways. In doing so, I hope to more confidently and consistently walk one of those pathways myself.
- Why the bloody hell not?
  collapsed:: true
	- Sometimes something just grips you and won’t let go.
	- Maybe projects like this need naivety and an ignorance of many "good" reasons for why it should't work. Best not listen to that voice too closely.
- Solutions depend on definition of the problem.
	- "When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."
- Siloed expertise may reinforce the problem

	- Commanders of 'the solution'
	- Impenetrability, demonstrated by language
	- Preachers, not practicers
- Because we are worth it.
