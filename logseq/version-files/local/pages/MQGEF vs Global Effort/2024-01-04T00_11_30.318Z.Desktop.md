MQGEF is Ph.D research.

Global Effort is initially
a) A way to get me to learn and deepen understanding on the topic by having to write about it to others. eg. Explaining what is Futures, Energy Transitions etc.
b) A space I can keep records ie a database of energy futures entities eg. organizations, thinkers, books, drivers, data etc.

Then, later, after sufficient Ph.D work, I hope Global Effort to become a 
i) consultancy and 
ii) think-tank.

On the relationship between MQGEF and Global Effort
MQGEF = Mapping and Questioning Global Energy Future
Global Effort = Global Energy Futures, Foresight and Transitions
