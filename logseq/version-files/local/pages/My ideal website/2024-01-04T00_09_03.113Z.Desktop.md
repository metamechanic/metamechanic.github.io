An ideal web site
Website searchable repository with visualised topic map
I want users to be able to navigate a visual map
GraphCommons?

Export to Neo4J. Visualize graph?
I am an admin-user of the site
I want to record objects to the web page through forms
Front end content creation
For an object I want to record essential data in particular universal fields
Fields/attributes/properties depend on object type


I want to situate them
I want to categorize them
I want to distill their ideas
I want to relate those ideas
I want to analogize ie. make an analogy, identify comparator
I want to identify the metaphor and myth
I want to adopt some of those ideas
I want users to be able to search this repository
At least one page is like a visual database
Searching brings up an entry with links
How is this different from Wikipedia?
Search
Search by category
Search by keyword
by field type
by resource type
eg. pdf, report, data viz etc.

Searchable front end
Folded Writing (collapsible content headers)
Heirarchical knowledge visualization
