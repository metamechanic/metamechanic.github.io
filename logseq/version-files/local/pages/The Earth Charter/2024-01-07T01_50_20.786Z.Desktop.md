	- ## What is the Earth Charter document?
	  
	  The Earth Charter (EC) is a document with sixteen principles powering a global movement. When you apply it to your business, school or community, you begin turning conscience into action to make all life on Earth thrive.
	  
	  The EC is an ethical foundation for actions to build a more just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. It articulates a mindset of global interdependence and shared responsibility. It offers a vision of hope and a call to action.
	  
	  The Earth Charter document starts with the [Preamble](https://earthcharter.org/read-the-earth-charter/preamble/), followed by the four pillars: [Respect and Care for the Community of Life](https://earthcharter.org/read-the-earth-charter/respect-and-care-for-the-community-of-life/), [Ecological Integrity](https://earthcharter.org/read-the-earth-charter/ecological-integrity/), [Social and Economic Justice](https://earthcharter.org/read-the-earth-charter/social-and-economic-justice/), and [Democracy, Nonviolence, and Peace](https://earthcharter.org/read-the-earth-charter/democracy-nonviolence-and-peace/). It concludes with [The Way Forward](https://earthcharter.org/read-the-earth-charter/the-way-forward/).
