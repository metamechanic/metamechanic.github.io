Everyone wants increasing [[EROEI]]

Reindeer herders in Kamchatka; subsistence farmers
Don't want to become reindeer

Everyone wants increasing EROEI
To do more with less
To get more by giving less

We need to relate labour, food, gross energy, oil etc to higher order forms of energy:
money
inner satisfaction and experience

Beyond a certain value, increased consumption of a particular level's form of energy introduces negative energy return...
and perhaps negative energy return on another level
reflects negative/low energy values on higher levels eg. eating disorder, monetary greed
