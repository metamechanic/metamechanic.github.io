	- **Quick Overview**
	  Mr. Speth explains how the bad habits of thought including individualism, materialism, consumerism, and tribalism do not make sense today, and a new consciousness is required. Mr. Speth emphasized that for a sustainable future, we need a stable or smaller world population, the eradication of mass poverty, environmentally benign technologies, environmentally honest prices, sustainable consumption, knowledge and learning, good governance, and the transition of culture and consciousness. Mr. Speth also gives thought to the role of education, religion, social movement, and role models. While recognizing the limitations of lawyers and scientists, he believes that what we need is not more analysis, but a **spiritual awakening** to a new consciousness, and so we should bring on the preachers, poets, psychologists, writers, artists, and so forth to strike the chords of our shared humanity.
