On patterns of knowledge over time
We have enough recorded history, and enough current knowledge to see patterns of knowledge
Some (fairly) recent discoveries have actually been rediscoveries
Some "great" discoveries have been disproved
Therefore, we can surmise that future knowledge will be one of a few categories
Completely novel
Rehash of previously refuted theory
An older theory reinterpreted eg. metaphor of old/sacred texts
Be proven to be true, but incomplete
Be proven to be total rubbish
Be laughingly mocked in the future
Be gently regarded as childish play (by the wisdom of the future)
Be regarded as blinding genius and revered as such (by the wise future)
