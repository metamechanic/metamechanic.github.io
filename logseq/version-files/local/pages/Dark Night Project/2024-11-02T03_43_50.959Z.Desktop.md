- # Willoughby Britton's Dark Night Project
  
  Dr. Willoughby Britton, an assistant professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University, has been studying the phenomenon of meditation-induced adverse effects, which she terms “the dark night.” Her research, known as the Dark Night Project, **aims to document, analyze, and publicize accounts of meditation-induced impairment**, challenging the prevailing narrative that meditation is universally beneficial.
- ## Background
  
  Britton’s investigation began after receiving reports from individuals who experienced severe psychological distress, including thoughts of self-harm and suicide, following meditation retreats. These accounts contradicted the widespread assumption that meditation is a safe and effective practice. Britton’s research seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms and prevalence of these adverse effects.
- ## Key Findings
- **Prevalence**: Britton’s study suggests that adverse effects of meditation are more common than previously thought, with over 50% of her patients reporting negative experiences.
- **Variability**: The Dark Night Project reveals that meditation-induced adverse effects can manifest in diverse ways, including:
	- Vivid, disturbing imagery
	- Unwanted sexual thoughts
	- Emotional turmoil
	- Dissociative experiences
	- Suicidal ideation
- **Lack of Acknowledgment**: Britton’s research highlights the widespread lack of recognition and acknowledgment of these adverse effects within the meditation community and among researchers.
- **Historical Context**: The concept of “dark night” has roots in Christian mysticism, describing a spiritual crisis in the pursuit of union with God. Britton’s study shows that similar experiences are reported across various contemplative traditions, including Buddhism, Sufism, and Christianity.
- ## Implications
  
  The Dark Night Project has significant implications for the meditation community, researchers, and practitioners:
- **Increased Awareness**: Recognizing the potential risks and adverse effects of meditation can help practitioners prepare for and better cope with challenging experiences.
- **Improved Research**: Britton’s study emphasizes the need for more comprehensive and nuanced research on meditation’s effects, including its potential risks and benefits.
- **Responsible Practice**: The Dark Night Project underscores the importance of responsible and informed meditation instruction, as well as the need for practitioners to be aware of their own limitations and boundaries.
  
  By shedding light on the darker side of meditation, Dr. Willoughby Britton’s Dark Night Project aims to promote a more balanced understanding of this complex practice and its potential effects on individuals.
