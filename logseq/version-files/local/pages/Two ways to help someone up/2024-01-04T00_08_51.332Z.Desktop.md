There are two ways to help someone
1. Give them a hand up; but you also have to:
2. Take your foot off their throat. (This is the iceberg under the water.)

We all want to be seen doing part 1.
We don't want to recognize we are secretly, and actively, doing part 2.

Why can't you get up when I am helping you up?
