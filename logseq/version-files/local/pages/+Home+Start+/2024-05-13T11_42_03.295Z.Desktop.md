  collapsed:: true
  The [knowledge garden]([[knowledge gardening]]) of me, [[Adam Duus]], the [MetaMechanic]([[What is a "metamechanic"?]])
	- My name is **Adam Duus**. I am an independent researcher working on a suite of [projects]([[Projects]])
	- I am interested in novel approaches to some [big questions and grand challenges]([[Big Questions]])
	- To address these challenges, I invite you to read more, teach me and engage in [[X-C Communities]]
	- I frame my interests and approach their treatment through an evolving toolbox of lenses, concepts, postulates and principles I loosely label [metamechanics]([[Metamechanica]])
	- I try to curate a list of [resources & references]([[Resources & References]])
	- Collaboration and curated community contributions are central to the projects and philosophy of metamechanics. You may be interested in growing an [X-C community]([[X-C Communities]])
	- Please contact me with suggestions, critique, questions and to get involved.

		- The thing with [Dunning-Kruger](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect) is you don't know you're Dunning-Krugering yet real innovation invariably comes from outside orthodoxy.
		-
	- Projects will eventually appear on social media though I am not the biggest fan and best user of it.

- ### Using this site
  collapsed:: true
  #toWrite
	- Written in [[Logseq]], one of the new generation of advanced connected note-taking tools
	- Features of this site
		- Bullet-point outline writing
			- You can get rid of the bullets but I actively sought this for [[Folded Writing]]. I apply [[TL;DR]] as standard to modern non-fiction content [[prosumption]] overload.
			- "Halo"
			  collapsed:: true
			  If the bullet point has a "halo" (like this one), it contains sub-points. Once the cursor is hovering somewhere over the bullet point text, an arrow will appear. Clicking the arrow will open/unfold the point to reveal sub-points.
				- Noice. Well played.
				- I believe this feature is particularly important in this age of [[information overload]], aka #TLDR. I employ this to practice [[Folded Writing]], and introduce orienting levels of information importance, like a Table of Contents but going further down.
			- Clicking on the bullet point itself will open that point on its "parent" point's own page, showing the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the screen.
		- Folding / drop-down headers/bullet points for [[Folded Writing]]
		- Links and Backlinks
			- Links
				- Backlinks
				- Tags
			- Linked backlinks
			- Unlinked backlinks
		- Pages and Blocks
		  collapsed:: true
			- Each bullet-point is a block, whether they contain sub-points or not.
			- Pages are made up of blocks. Blocks can contain sub-blocks (sub-points).
				- The difference is that pages are an actual file while blocks are not, though blocks can be turned into pages, if desired.
			- Embedding pages and blocks
				- Pages and blocks can be "embedded" into other pages and blocks. These can be identified as having a background colour/border and different icons.
		- Information Graph
		  collapsed:: true
			- aka *Page Graph*, this is a network diagram of connections between notes
			- Currently the links are only hyper-textual relationships and not conceptual relationships
			- I hope to incorporate [[Knowledge Cartography]] here via a typology of links between notes beyond hypertext links
				- An example would be [[Concept Mapping]]
		- Sidebar - left
		  collapsed:: true
			- Works like a menu bar
			- Contains key pages
		- Sidebar - right
		  collapsed:: true
			- Holding the 'shift' button and clicking on a link will open the right sidebar.
			- An interesting feature visible here is the *Page Graph* visible via link at top of sidebar
			- Using your mouse scroll wheel or laptop touchpad to zoom in/out of the page graph
		- Navigation
		  collapsed:: true
			- Browser "back" button
			- Home/house icon at top
			- "All pages" gives a list of all pages
			  collapsed:: true
				- default organised by date modified
				- click on header to sort by that header
			- Page graph view
