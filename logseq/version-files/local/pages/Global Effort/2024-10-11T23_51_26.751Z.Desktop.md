	- individual energy futures stakeholders
	- energy futures types
	- country
	- time frame
	- dominant energy production sources
	- dominant energy use sinks
	- Energy per capita - low, medium, high (would need to determine numbers)

	- Degree of decentralization of energy production
	- Degree of reliance on fossil fuels
- Wiki can create many hyperlinks from many things to many things. Store research notes, summaries of futures, techniques etc as wiki-hypertext linked. Each instance can be rated on each [suitable] dimensional axis
- Menus & Categories. Need data taxonomy.
