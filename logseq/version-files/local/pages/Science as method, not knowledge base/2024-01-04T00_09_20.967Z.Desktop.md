Science as method, not knowledge base.

There is a difference between scientific knowledge and knowledge gleaned through science. The former implies or emphasises a body of knowledge, the latter the process or method of scientifc inquiry. If the method is prioritised, the tools deemed acceptable are opened up, and the knowledge allowed is broadened in scope.

Whereas if the former is emphasised, the knowledge is the fixation.
