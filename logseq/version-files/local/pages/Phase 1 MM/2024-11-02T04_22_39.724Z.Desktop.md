	- explain to those closest to me (eg. family, colleagues) why I believe the things I believe, and pursue the things I pursue.
	- define purpose, vision, limits of each project
	- sketch & outline products
	- differentiate uniqueness, need and value
	- communicate, outreach
	- inspire collaboration and contribution
	- constructive criticism from [[Phase 1 MM audience]]; argument & approach rigour

	- Avoid excessive editing, polishing, re-factoring, duplicating

- Purpose of Phase 1 writing. Writing in order to:
  collapsed:: true
	- orient - what is my/our position in the noosphere; where do we want to go?
	- clarify...my own thinking, philosophy, prinicples...as well as gaps and needs.
	- inspire participation, readership:
	- define boundaries, limits
	- distinguish from other efforts
		- why important
		- why unique
		- what do we do that other's don't
		- what don't/won't we do that others do do
- Each project has at end of Phase 1:
  collapsed:: true
	- 1 page project proposal
	- 5 page project proposal
	- sitemap on Logseq
	- Macrobout complete
	- 20 "profile cards" in each of 5 types (eg. person, document, organisation,)
	- 5 x blogs in long-form folded writing
	- 1 exemplar
		- argument map
	- "Top-level" product
		- EFA top-level story thread
			- Food, water, money
- Characteristics of Phase 1 writing;
  collapsed:: true
	- Definitive & canonical
	- Prototype
	- Exemplar
	- Differentiating
	- Hypothetical, intuitive, exploratory...with need to research and make rigorous LATER
	- Rapid, agile, succeed by failing, working with garage open
- Writing for whom:
  collapsed:: true
	- 18~25 year old Adam: what I wish I'd known, understood or been exposed to earlier
	- 90 year old Adam: what I wish I'd explored, investigated, communicated and attempted by the end
	- current Adam: writing for thinking and clarifying
	- potential collaborators
	- potential funders
	- those closest to me who would like to understand me
	- [[Phase 1 MM audience]]
-
- Metamechanic Mycelium & metamechanic.io Phase 1 needs and not-needs
  collapsed:: true
	- needs
		- single note repository underlying all projects
		- task prioritization tool
		- backlinking, wikilinking, predictive note linking
		- show mock-ups
		- project URL redirect to showcase page
		- [[AI]] incorporation ??
	- does not need
		- separate websites for each project
		  collapsed:: true
			- I need the unified knowledge respository underlying all projects and I don't have the tech skills to do this for separate websites
		- separate workspaces, graph databases
		- excessive polish
			- only enough to adequately communicate requirements and vision
		- outward-facing aspect
			- for
				- recruitment of collaborators
				- attraction of funding
				- invitation of ideas
			- does not need to be overly visual and incorporate visual components except where data visualization and argument mapping required.
- Workflow
  collapsed:: true
	- Do
		- enter writing freely
		- tag readily and heavily
		- consolidate pre-existing notes
			- TBX
			- Scrivener
			- et al
		- learn to use tools of Logseq efficiently
			- transclusion
			- todo
			- tags
		- develop taxonomy and document it
		- document (ie. tag) heavily
		- use journal as primary entry point inconjunction with TAGS
		- occasional cleaning up of notes
			- via file size
			- via graph view
	- Do not
		- look for other platforms. Stick to Logseq for Phase 1
		- worry about "weeds in the garden" too much ie. that everything is not neat and tidy
		-
- Platforms, Apps
  collapsed:: true
	- Outward platforms
		- need collaboration and commentary functionality
		- hash.ai
		- Logseq DB version
		- Obsidian Publish with Juggl plug-in maps
		- Notion, Coda, Capacities, Anytype
	- Inward platforms?
		- Logseq DB (when it is released)
		- Obsidian
		- ...but want some database/table/card functionality
	- TEMPLATES (not Logseq templates)
		- References
		- People
		- Data viz (eg. for EFA)
		- Sites/locations
-
- This is the writing that the first community participants, supporters, developers and backers will read
	- How many? 3-10? Can't be too many as then it will have to be more polished.
- Obviously I can't write everything. I have too many projects, and they are large in scope.
- Therefore, I must judiciously focus my writing to **balance breadth with depth**
	- Cover enough breadth to frame scope, purvue
	- Set the tone, philosophy, spirit, intentions
	- yet also provide enough detail, depth

	- Wireframe
