The alternative response to arbitrary power relationships and structures is metaphysics/ meta-mechanics. Instead of 'just saying' or pointing to human- or world made documents, we can rely on metaphysical principles and true cause-effect laws. Use of These principles will affirm and amplify human ideals and ideas.  

In fact, they already do. Our current power structures, as well as all systems, reflect our idea of ourselves. That can be Magnitude, or it can be littleness. 

We use mistaken meta mechanics.  Or, alternatively said, we misuse metaphysics for mistaken ends.
