alias:: my writing method in Logseq
tags:: #RRW #TLDR 
project:: #[[Metamechanic Mycelium]] 
see-also:: #[[block writing]]

- Tag heavily
	- update [[Metamechanic ontology]] routinely
- Write pages as short blocks then 'page embed' or 'block embed' so I can fold them #[[block writing]]
- Don't make pages too long
	- what is the guidance here?
- Where is the length limit?
	- Single bullet point/node like Tana is too short
	- Long-form (like Obsidian) is not the style I'm after
- Ask myself at each point: what is the smallest block that will make sense by itself?
	- {{embed ((678ae851-1659-4b1a-9a22-8d821a32df1f))}}
- Answer questions
	- Have a clear research question and sub-questions for each task
	- Write to these questions
- Use markdown headings
