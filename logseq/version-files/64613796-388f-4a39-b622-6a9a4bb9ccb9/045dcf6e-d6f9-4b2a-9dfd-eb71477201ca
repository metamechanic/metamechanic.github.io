- Principles
  collapsed:: true
	- God exists
	- God exists but He did not make the world
	- God is not 'She'. God is not 'He'. God is not even 'It'.
	- You can't fix what is designed to be broken.
	- The ego wants to be God
	- God, "God"/god, Gods and gods
	- There is no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as faithlessness.
	- Everthing except God is metaphor.
		- "god" is a metaphor for my worldview ?
	- Everything except God is technology.
	- Technology attempts to mimic the mind.
	- Truth vs Truth-tool
	- Paradox
	- Consciousness as idol
	- Brain and heart as "signal receivers" or "signal detectors" rather than "signal generators"
	- The one real problem – a sense of separation from Source.
	- Projection vs Extension
	- Creation & Miscreation
	- Guilt, fear & punishment
	- Form vs Content
	- Religion as technology. Science as religion. Science as spirituality.
	- Everyone believes in God. But not everyone believes in their definition of “God”.
	- God is changeless. God is limitless. God is uncharacterizable. God is.
		- God creates as itself.
	- The world/universe was created as an escape from guilt, fear & punishment.
- Points
	- Anthropomorphic principle
	- Spiritual vs spiritual
	  ‘Spiritual’, ‘spiritual’, ’Self’, ‘self’ and ‘sacred’
	- Definitions of God
	- Questioning
		- ...as genuine inquiry and discovery
		- ...as a delay manoever and divisive mechanism
	- The history of the world is the story of the projection of pollution, pain, power-source and problem-source onto others.
		- Victims and victimisers
		-
	- The Bible (New & Old Testaments), and the story of its development, consist of multiple components. SO, THEREFORE, WE MUST SEPARATE THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF. DON’T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER.
	- Implement the message. Don’t idolise the man. Try to follow the example yourself. Don’t make an example of the failings of others.
	- Worldly problems are the ego’s distraction tactic from the one real problem – a sense of separation from Source. This idea is the very ego itself, so worldly problems are the ego’s survival mechanism.
	- The world of form – the universe of time & space – is like a holographic dream.
		- An image
		- An illusion
		- A dream
		- An optical delusion
		- A hologram
		- A projection
	- Anything that requires defense is inherently weak.
	- Anger, doubt, jealousy, confusion, hatred, cynicism, boredom, apathy…are all masks of fear. Fear arises from a sense of guilt because a sense of guilt calls for punishment. Therefore surface fears are the tip of the iceberg of the deeper fear of punishment from God.
	- FORCK closes the gap between you and your (br)others. This includes species, objects, thought systems and not only people. Furthermore, this includes your other selves. (We all carry multiple voices, multiple role players)
	- Reincarnation is also an illusion. As our souls.
	- Interconnectedness (is not oneness). Synchronicity is of the ego or the Holy Spirit.
	- Beliefs don’t make Reality or Truth but they do make the appearance of it, and the experience of it.
	- Purpose is everything. Motivation, moreso than mechanism, determines outcome.
	- All thinking is circular. At our deepest level, we are always proving our premise. However, some part of the circle may have been ‘conveniently’ forgotten to absolve ourselves of responsibility.
	- The universe is a closed-loop system. The universe of form/separation/space-time is designed to reinforce itself as true and real.
	- Spiritual development is the shift of all power being seemingly outside and external to oneself, to the recognition that all power is within oneself. That all responsibility lies with me.
	- Spiritual development is the shift from taking zero responsibility for one’s situation to total responsibility for one’s situation.
	- Spiritual growth is the expansion of the circle of compassion. More identifying types are included -> Neohumanism / Sarkar circle
		- Expanding the circle of identity.
	- The real jihad is the one within, with your own demons.
	- God is completely benign.
		- Total benignity is a very difficult concept to appreciate. 
		  God created You. And God only creates perfectly. God created You perfect, pure, sinless and totally worthy of love. He knows You better than You do. He knows you to be perfect. Therefore, there is nothing really in You that requires forgiveness of God.
	- Otherism
		- Discrimination by being an ‘other’. Prejudice against an other.
		- Everyone is ‘otherist’
		- We deny it by making special forms of ‘otherism’ and valuing
		- Do you get upset at someone else? Do you get upset at yourself? If so, then you are otherist. Why? Because you are saying “You are the cause of my suffering.”
		- The only possibility to world peace is through inner peace, which comes from recognising and then accepting that you are otherist. Only then can you forgive yourself.
		- Otherism is only resolved through the realisation that there is no other. This realisation is facilitated through the practice of advanced forgiveness and compassion.
	- Speciesism
		- Discrimination by species. Etymology follows ‘racism’, ‘sexism’, ‘age-ism’
		- Formation of identity through identification with species, and as a species. Etymology follows ‘Buddhism’, ‘Judaism’, ‘Positivism’, ‘Pluralism’
	- From…
		- The world will be okay when you change what you believe.
		  The world will work when you change what you do.

  collapsed:: true
	- God created bodies
	- God created the world and the universe.
	- Jesus is the Son of God.
	- God's Word is the Bible.
	- God is mysterious, unknowable.
	- God is judgmental.
	- Consciousness is of God
	- God forgives.
		- God doesn't forgive because God never condemned.
	- Jesus didn’t know about his imminent crucifixion
	- God wants us to be rich. God wants us to be poor.
	- God wants to test you.
	- God & Jesus wants you to suffer for him.
	- Renouncing the world means asceticism.
	- Non-violence refers to physical actions. (It actually refers to the mind.)
	- Sacred places. Sacred geometry. Sacred texts.
	- On “prayer”. Ie. Prayer is not petitionary. We are always praying.
	- Vegetarianism & Food in spirituality.
	- Pilgrimage.
	- Ritual.
	- Science & Religion. Science vs Religion.
	- God & social justice
	- God & politics, law, economy
	- Jesus & the money lenders. "Do not lend at interest" is metaphor
	- Resurrection vs the Crucifixion
	- Jesus suffered pain on the cross.
	- Body, Mind & Spirit (this is a confusion of levels)
	- Buddha died from contaminated pork
	- Jesus was betrayed by Judas
	- Prayer is petitionary
	- God = The Church
	- Temptation. It is not temptation to fall into wild and wicked ways. It is temptation to consider oneself a victim; temptation to judge; temptation to hold grievances.
	- Heaven is not attained by death. Heaven must be attained by Life.
	- God loves complexity. In fact, he does not. God is simple for God is One, without levels, aspects, components and change.
	- The path to God is simple. But not easy. That’s not because of God. That’s because I/we/the ego have made it so.
	- Death is bad. Death is pain.
		- (Dying is painful. Physical death is temporary release from pain, the body. Death only temporarily cures pain. Freedom from pain)
	- God is on “our” side.
		- Yes, God is on your team but not “against the other team”. God is on “all sides”. God doesn’t share the same goal you think you do. God would have you be without opponents, adversaries, enemies or others.
	- Parapsychic powers don’t necessarily indicate spiritual advancement.
	- Sin is bad, requiring punishment.
		- Correction: Sin is merely mistake, calling for forgiveness and re-direction. ‘Sin’ is a mistranslation from the Greek ‘X’? which more accurately means ‘to miss the mark’. It is simply an error in direction, a mistake in judgment. In fact, the mistake IS judgment. Just like any archer firing an arrow, a footballer kicking a goal, a singer hitting a key, ‘hitting the mark’ requires practice. Relentless practice, if the level of proficiency is to be high. To hit the mark of peace, love and joy requires continual, patient practice of the untrained mind. Mistakes are inevitable. This is the process of forgiveness – forgiving our erroneous misthoughts until we no longer miss the mark.
	- God is not a He. God is not a She.. Correction: but there is value to calling It an It, and It a ‘He’. Forgiveness opportunity. And because we think we are human, we relate better to an anthropomorphization, a personality. Our current concept of love is body-based so it may be helpful to think of It as Him/Her. However, to insist that It is a Him/Her is to make a mistake. To insist that God be a She, for example, in response to millennia of patriarchal repression, is to make the same mistake as calling It a He.
	  God is not even an ‘It’. When we say ‘It’ we are talking as if ‘It’ is separate from us. Yet God
	- God has nothing to do with evolution
	- Morals are handed down by God or result from the genetic survival imperative.
		- (They are expressions of metaphysical law. Ie. God won’t punish you for breaking the ten commandments or disavowing Jesus. Suffering is a self-imposed consequence of not understanding metaphysical mechanisms)
	- God did not create religion.
	- God deals out Karma. (No. The ego dishes out Karma, because it made need of karma)

- Practices
  collapsed:: true
	- The truth doesn’t require defence. However, our Truth “muscle” is very weak and thus requires vigilance against the attacks of the ego.
	- Seek not to change your behaviour. Seek to change your mind.
	- All practice – spiritual, religious, scientific, artistic, mundane – is valuable if it promotes forgiveness, compassion and kindness.
	- Spiritual progress is measured by an increasing experience of peace, not by time spent meditating or healing modalities mastered.

- Summary / Intro
  collapsed:: true
	- Inner Beginner is a manual for those seeking greater meaning, peace and joy in their lives.
	  Inner Beginner is a guide for those on, or about to embark on, the journey within but who may have reservations and misgivings about spiritual practice.
	- Inner Beginner is a simple introductory text on applied metaphysics, offering a model of God-Universe-Space-Time Organization (GUSTO) that allows for peace in a world of suffering and separation.
	- Inner Beginner is a clearinghouse of some alternative and lesser known spiritual practices that offer depth, rigour and example.
	- Inner Beginner is a clarification and discussion of misconceptions and myths around God, church, religious texts and teachings for seekers of peace and healing.
	- In an era of unprecedented material affluence and advanced technology, incredible misery and suffering persists. This pain is evident not only in the lives of many of the materially impoverished and those witness to war, violence and catastrophe. The struggle, strain and stress resides in the hearts and minds of all of us. Globalized telecommunications and media make this agony all the more apparent and accessible.
	- Many people are seeking to make sense of their lives and the world in the face of this suffering. Many more people are seeking meaning and value where the accelerating appearance of new technology is failing. Many more people are beginning to look within for some calm amidst the storm.
	- Yet many people are discouraged or delayed from spiritual practice by the incongruence of many existing religious and spiritual paths. Traditional religion has let many people down. New Atheism may be an advancement but may leave you uninspired and unsatisfied with its lack of imagination and self-awareness. The New Age embraces scientific developments but may suffer from a lack of depth, rigour and example. What to do then?
	- Don’t give up. There are alternatives. God, peace, joy and happiness are not dead, despite the best efforts of many to kill It, or at least make It boring and painful. All spiritual ideas and anti-ideas still hold immense value despite criticisms and failures. Yet this book will try to help you make some sense of them. This guide aims to heal our misguided ideas about Spirit, the spiritual path and spiritual practice.
	- This is not a book on comparative religion. The aim is not to remain in the realm of theory, academia or curiosity. Rather we hope to delve into the depths of experience. For this, a map that inspires is required, as is a system of practice to traverse the territory. Inner Beginner offers an outline of the first and many lesser known options for the second that may prove more satisfying and rigorous.
	- The ideas in this book may not be new to you. Their aggregation, and philosophical consequences of this, may be new, and may be challenging. Yet in challenge lies reward.

- Motivation for this Book
- Rescuing God
  collapsed:: true
	- The image and concept of God needs to be rescued. Not for God’s sake: It is invulnerable and invincible, by definition, and knows not of suffering. Neither for the sake of religion: it should not be the goal, but merely a means. Neither should the idea of God be rescued to counter-attack science: We are all on the same side and it is one attempt to seek Truth, albeit misguided at times. Rather, the image and concept of God needs to be rescued for our own sanity, our own peace of mind.
	- War is raged ‘for’ God. War is raged against ‘God’. Destruction and suffering is claimed to be raged by God. This insane violence, conflict and abuse, both in the external world and inner minds, both overtly obvious and covertly subtle, is based on images and concepts of God which are insane, violent, conflicted and abusive. It gives rise to a metaphysical systems which reinforce and perpetuate the insanity and abuse, yet fail to stand up to progressive critical thinking.
	- It is time to take the blame off God. It is time to stop using God as a convenient excuse for our own subconscious desires for conflict and pain. It is time to time to take responsibility for our own peace and prosperity. To do this we need God for we have taught ourselves that pain and birth-death is the natural way of things, resulting in a world of empty idols and repetitive suffering.
	- We need God to teach us how to love for we have clearly forgotten this.
	- We need God to teach us wisdom in a ‘civilized’ world that has tried and failed at that since it began. And to begin this we need a more loving, wise and kind image and concept of God so that we may avail ourselves of Infinite Wisdom and Perfect Love.
- Disclosure Statement & Closing comments
  collapsed:: true
	- Transparency
	  I am an ACIM student. My study & practice of ACIM has inspired me to write this book.
	  However…
	  The ideas reflected in this book do not necessarily represent the teachings of ACIM. For that you must read, study and apply The Course yourself.
	  This is not an advertisement for ACIM, per se. It is not an advertisement for any one particular spiritual faith, tradition, denomination, group or whatever.
	  It is, however, an appeal to FORCK. It is an appeal to become more forgiving, more compassionate and more kind. Metaphysics is presented here to facilitate this. Myths and misconceptions are discussed to help remove barriers to FORCKing yourself. This book is an appeal to you to undertake whatever spiritual practice helps you become more FORCK. I don’t care if its ACIM or not. That is just the truth-tool I use. It works for me. Just remember, whatever spiritual path you pursue is not the Truth. It is a way to Truth.
	- I am not a spiritual teacher, of ACIM or anything else. I have the worldly teachers I respect and refer to, according to the guidance of the higher Teacher within (the Teacher that resides within all of us).
	  Disclosure statement: My work inspired by ACIM, or rather, the Presence that the practice of ACIM makes available to me.
