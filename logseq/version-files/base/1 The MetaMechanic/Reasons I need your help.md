Reasons I need your help
I need help to undertake these projects. Massive help.

This is for 2 reasons:

Alone, I do not possess the resources to accomplish them. I do not have all the skills, the time or the money. Neither do I have all of the answers, if I have any of them.

It is a central philosophy of these projects that any answer lies in joining. Not joining in body or form but joining in mind or spirit. Thus these projects require brilliant, creative and/or supportive minds to share:

Common purpose
Unified vision
Coherent action
