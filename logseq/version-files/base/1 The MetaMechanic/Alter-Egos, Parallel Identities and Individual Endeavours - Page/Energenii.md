Energenii = 	Energy + Genii
Energy =	1. Fossil fuels, nuclear, renewables, advanced “free” energy technologies
		2. The range of vibrations characterising all matter and thought
		3. Life force, creative spark, joie de vivre, dynamism inherent in all
Genii = 	1. Plural of “genius”

The term “Energenii”, therefore, symbolises 
harnessing the value in each of us through 
joining and uniting in mind and spirit to 
access and release collective genius and wisdom for 
the creation and realisation of alternatives to current situations in
all domains of endeavour with
a particular, but not exclusive, application to gross energy issues
