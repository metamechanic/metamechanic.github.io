Position Statement
Everyone has part of the answer. No one has all of the answer.
The possible is only limited by imagination, will and awareness.
Truth and truth-tools are consistently confused. Truth-tools are mistaken as truth and thus useful tools degenerate into divisive idols.
Science, religion, economics, politics, sustainability et al are all technologies and, as such, can be used to promote peace or reinforce fear. 
There is much more to the truth than we think. I/we know less than I/we think I/we do. Yet, I/we are capable of learning much more than I/we think is possible.
Weâ€™re all looking for the same thing, whatever name you give it. Unfortunately, most of us are looking in the wrong place.
Objectivity and neutrality do not exist. Everyone has a position and biases. Often these are implicit or unconscious. This is not a bad thing. However, failing to acknowledge this is costly.
