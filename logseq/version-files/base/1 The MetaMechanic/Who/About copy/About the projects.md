About the projects
The projects may initially appear to be academic, for that is my bent, but ultimately they carry practical applications and implications. Or so they should. Or they have the possibility to if executed and viewed correctly.

Some common themes and features uniting them are intended to be:
Orient for peace as the goal, as well as the path
Promote alternative, controversial, expanded thinking & fresh perspectives. 
Remind that context is critical.
Explore deeper, non-technical & metaphysical aspects and dimensions of science, technology & resource management
Focus on process (and product will take care of itself)
Argue that motivation (inner content) is more important than form
Imbue a belief in possibility… 
Inspire creative thought
Encourage participation and collaborative creation
Advance spiritual practice (in general) as the means for fulfillment as well as the source of inspired, creative, win-win thinking

  collapsed:: true
	- Applying metaphysics to universal challenges
	  collapsed:: true
		- Mechanics is physics applied to fix and function. Metamechanics is metaphysics applied to heal and transform. Apply now.
	- Fresh approaches to current problems
	  collapsed:: true
		- Persistent problems require a radical review. Metamechanics provides an alternative to stale thought. Get fresh.
	- Society. Spirituality. Science. Service.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Scientifically sound. Spiritually substantial. Socially sensitive. Symbiotic service. Submit solutions.
	- MacroScience & MetaTechnology
	  collapsed:: true
		- A bigger concept of science. A higher concept of technology. Metamechanics retools modern icons and leverages enlightened ideas. Tool time.
	- Getting to the heart of the problem.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Illuminating deep intentions and pondering layers of purpose. Metamechanics marries motivations, meaning, method and mission. Hearty helpings.
	- Collaborate. Innovate. Illuminate. Elevate. Transmutate.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Metamechanics recognizes the "I" and the "us" in genius. Bring your magic lamp to light up the world. Don't hesitate.
	- Confounding challenges calling for your contribution
	  collapsed:: true
		- Isolation, fragmentation, alienation are recipes for failure and waste. Your input is essential for success. Please join the effort. Please share the reward. Connect & connive.
	- Critical complexities compelling collaboration
	  collapsed:: true
		- Navigable complexity. Tranquil chaos. Healing crises. Symbiotic conflict.
	- Metamechanics employs and addresses paradox, contradictions, dissonance and syzygy for inspiration and illumination. The messiness of the real world is refactored, reframed and refreshed.
- Each project will be an entity unto itself, bigger than any one person, serving the multitudes. A baby conceived, and released to the community to nurture it and develop it. Resilient organisations and vital communities which illuminate and elevate.
- Adventures in effective alternatives.
- Getting to the heart of the problem.
	- Illuminating deep factors and uncovering layers of function. Metamechanic endeavours examine motivation, meaning, method and mechanism, leading ultimately to a coherent, clear message of hope. Hearty helpings.
- Fresh approaches to current problems
	- Persistent problems require a radical review. Metamechanic projects provide an alternative to stale thought.  Metamechanic projects question dominant assertions, prevailing assumptions, and the efficacy of orthodox approaches. Get fresh.
- Stimulating stagnation. Provoking progress
	- Is the world going around in circles? On an axis of evil? Or an orbit of insanity? Or a scenic ascent to the summit? Metamechanics projects review the trails, question the trajectory, visualise new tracks and navigate transitions. Poke. Provoke.
- Society. Spirituality. Science. Service.
	- Scientifically sound. Spiritually substantial. Socially sensitive. Symbiotic service.  Metamechanic projects rely on cultivating communities of critical, compassionate thinkers to harvest collective IQ, EQ & SQ. Submit solutions.
- Metamechanic projects aim to distill, discover, distinguish and distribute genuine alternatives. Different sides of the same coin have no more purchasing power. New currencies are needed. Make an offer.
- Metamechanics recognizes the "I" and the "us" in genius. Projects aim to tap latent collective wisdom by leveraging collaborative insight and individual expertise. Bring your magic lamp to light up the world. Don't hesitate.
- Metamechanics projects attempt to leverage the points of maximum return for as many global symptoms as possible. What and where are they? How to access and activate them? Metamechanic projects seek the hidden trapdoor and golden key.
- Metamechanic initiatives seek simplification of the world’s perplexing complexities, revealing the essence of the problem, and recognition of the optimal solution.
- Big picture really must mean big picture
- Solving by simplifying. Healing by subtraction.
- Inner-vation for innovation
- Metamechanic projects typically involve questioning what constitutes “innovation” and “ingenuity”. The hypothesis: true innovation comes from inspiration and inner-vation.
- Questioning change. Changing the question.
- So many change-makers. So few make change. What is change? What is real change? What is real? Help these projects not add to the list of samsaric solutions.
