About  Adam Duus
Male. 35. Australian by birth and citizenship. Caucasian. Middle-class. Slowly balding. Rapidly broadening.

Aspiring citizen of the world. Spiritual seeker. Funniest man I know. Alas, not the prettiest man I know.

Educated in hard sciences. Now also embracing the softer side of theory. 

Likes movies, sport, travel, chocolate. Dislikes ants in my shower and that gentle breeze which makes me realise I’m showing a plumbers’ crack.
