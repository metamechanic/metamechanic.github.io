About the site
This site is a portfolio for all professional projects and enterprises I am currently undertaking and/or plan on beginning in the near future. It also acts as a resume for potential employers, investors and collaborators.

While the projects and site may be professionally oriented, I find it difficult to separate this aspect from my personal values and life. The professional is an extension and expression of the personal.
