Otherism
	•	Discrimination by being an ‘other’. Prejudice against an other.
	•	Everyone is ‘otherist’
	•	We deny it by making special forms of ‘otherism’ and valuing 
	•	Do you get upset at someone else? Do you get upset at yourself? If so, then you are otherist. Why? Because you are saying “You are the cause of my suffering.”
	•	The only possibility to world peace is through inner peace, which comes from recognising and then accepting that you are otherist. Only then can you forgive yourself.
	•	Otherism is only resolved through the realisation that there is no other. This realisation is facilitated through the practice of advanced forgiveness and compassion.
