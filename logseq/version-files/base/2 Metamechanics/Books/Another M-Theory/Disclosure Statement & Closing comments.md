I am an ACIM student. My study & practice of ACIM has inspired me to write this book. 
However…
The ideas reflected in this book do not necessarily represent the teachings of ACIM. For that you must read, study and apply The Course yourself.
This is not an advertisement for ACIM, per se. It is not an advertisement for any one particular spiritual faith, tradition, denomination, group or whatever.
It is, however, an appeal to FORCK. It is an appeal to become more forgiving, more compassionate and more kind. Metaphysics is presented here to facilitate this. Myths and misconceptions are discussed to help remove barriers to FORCKing yourself. This book is an appeal to you to undertake whatever spiritual practice helps you become more FORCK. I don’t care if its ACIM or not. That is just the truth-tool I use. It works for me. Just remember, whatever spiritual path you pursue is not the Truth. It is a way to Truth.

I am not a spiritual teacher, of ACIM or anything else. I have the worldly teachers I respect and refer to, according to the guidance of the higher Teacher within (the Teacher that resides within all of us).
