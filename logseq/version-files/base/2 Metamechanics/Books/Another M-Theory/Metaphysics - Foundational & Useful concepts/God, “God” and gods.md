God, “God” and gods

-
- God, “God” and gods
- Everyone believes in God
  Not everyone believes in their concept of “God”
  God is beyond conception
- If any concept promotes forgiveness, then it is helpful and worthy
- There is only one God, by definition. In fact, there is only God. There is also, however, many different views of God. They are conceptualisations of God, necessitated by a limited mind attempting to grasp the infinite. They are helpful to the extent that they foster peace and joy and encourage forgiveness. They are not, however, the truth.
- There is no absence of belief. Atheism is still a religion. The object of worship is just different; the clergy are not officially ordained, but unofficially; the texts recited from are different.
- The dominant image of God is as Creator of the Earth or as judge of right & wrong. This is limited and confining the concept of God to this range is not helpful. What are other concepts, images or metaphors of God that would be more helpful? An alternative perspective of God is that of Source of meaning and purpose and love. Another is that of limitlessness.
- God – is beyond definition
  “God” – is what we believe, everything we believe, particulary unconsciously and implicitly
  gods – the little idols of form we hold up as the source of our meaning and purpose
