Relationships

Everyone believes in God. But not everyone believes in their definition of “God”.
God did not create the world.
The ego created the universe of form, time & space.
The world/universe was created as an escape from guilt, fear & punishment.
The ego wants to be God.
The universe is the ego’s attempt to imitate/replicate Heaven.
Interconnectedness (is not oneness)
Synchronicity

Yet it is the nature of the ego to separate and fragment. Thus the world of multiplicity.
The Bible (New & Old Testaments), and the story of its development, consist of multiple components:
Record of some historical facts – terrestrial & extra-terrestrial
Spiritual teachings – correctly understood
Spiritual teachings – misinterpreted & misquoted
Spiritual teachings – metaphor & parable
Spiritual teachings – distorted & 
Guides for practical living in various contexts
Innocent mistakes of record & misinterpretation of messages
Intentional falsehoods & misleading messages
The truth of God & the falsehoods of man
Myths, the masks of God and projection / anthropomorphization
Translation and interpretation errors
Political power play
Nature worship/pagan 
…
SO, THEREFORE, WE MUST SEPARATE THE WHEAT FROM THE CHAFF. DON’T THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATHWATER.
The map is not the territory.
Implement the message. Don’t idolise the man. Try to follow the example yourself. Don’t make an example of the failings of others.
One God. Oneness of God. Many names. Many faces. Many paths.
God is changeless. God is limitless. God is uncharacterizable. God is.
God creates as itself.
Everything is technology. That includes ideas, concepts and thought systems.
Your experience is evidence of your beliefs.
Beliefs don’t make Reality or Truth but they do make the appearance of it.
The world confuses Truth with truth-tools.
History is the story of the projection of power, pain, pollution.
Anything that requires defense is inherently weak.
The truth doesn’t require defence. However, our Truth “muscle” is very weak and thus requires vigilance against the attacks of the ego. 
Worldly problems are the ego’s distraction tactic from the one real problem – a sense of separation from Source. This idea is the very ego itself, so worldly problems are the ego’s survival mechanism.
The Holy Spirit (the memory of God)…(forgot what I was thinking here! Ha!)
The world of form – the universe of time & space – is like a holographic dream.
An image
An illusion
A dream
An optical delusion
A hologram
A projection
Seek not to change your behaviour. Seek to change your mind.
Anger, doubt, jealousy, confusion, hatred, cynicism, boredom, apathy…are all masks of fear. Fear arises from a sense of guilt because a sense of guilt calls for punishment. Therefore surface fears are the tip of the iceberg of the deeper fear of punishment from God.
FORCK closes the gap between you and your (br)others. This includes species, objects, thought systems and not only people. Furthermore, this includes your other selves. (We all carry multiple voices, multiple role players)
Meditation & prayer access the Inner Teacher and Higher Power that lies within all of us.
Motivation is everything. Motivation, moreso than mechanism, determines outcome.
All thinking is circular. At our deepest level, we are always proving our premise.
