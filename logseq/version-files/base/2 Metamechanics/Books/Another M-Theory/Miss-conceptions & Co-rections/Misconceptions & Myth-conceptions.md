Misconception:	God created the universe and the world. 
God’s creations are limitless and pure, perfect love. God created Heaven. The ego created the universe of form, time & space.

Misconception:	God created bodies.
The ego creates bodies. Bodies are the home/palace of the ego. The ego seeks to make idols out of bodies.

Misconception:	Jesus is God’s son.
Christ is the Son of God. 
(“Jesus, Christ, Jesus Christ and the Son of God)

God’s Word is the Bible / Koran / Torah / 
God is unknowable. God is mysterious.
God is serious. 
God is judgmental. Judgment Day.
Misconception:	God forgives.
God doesn’t forgive because God never condemned.

God is completely benign. Total benignity is a very difficult concept to appreciate. 
God created You. And God only creates perfectly. God created You perfect, pure, sinless and totally worthy of love. He knows You better than You do. He knows you to be perfect. Therefore, there is nothing really in You that requires forgiveness of God.

What is required, however, is our own forgiveness of ourselves and our deep-seated, unconscious guilt. I miscreated something imperfect and 

Jesus didn’t know about his imminent crucifixion

God wants to test you.
God & Jesus wants you to suffer for him.
Renouncing the world means asceticism.
Non-violence refers to physical actions. (It actually refers to the mind.)
Sacred places. Sacred geometry. Sacred texts.
On “prayer”. Ie. Prayer is not petitionary. We are always praying.

Science & Religion. Science vs Religion.

Body, Mind & Spirit (this is a confusion of levels)
Buddha died from contaminated pork
Jesus was betrayed by Judas
Prayer is petitionary
God = The Church
Temptation. It is not temptation to fall into wild and wicked ways. It is temptation to consider oneself a victim; temptation to judge; temptation to hold grievances.
Heaven is not attained by death. Heaven must be attained by Life.
Not everything is energy! God is not energy.
God loves complexity. In fact, he does not. God is simple for God is One, without levels, aspects, components and change. 
The path to God is simple. But not easy. That’s not because of God. That’s because I/we/the ego have made it so.
Death is bad. Death is pain. (Dying is painful. Physical death is temporary release from pain, the body. Death only temporarily cures pain. Freedom from pain)
God is on “our” side. Yes, God is on your team but not “against the other team”. God is on “all sides”. God doesn’t share the same goal you think you do. God would have you be without opponents, adversaries, enemies or others.
Parapsychic powers don’t necessarily indicate spiritual advancement.
Motivation of Meditation.
Sin is bad, requiring punishment. Correction: Sin is merely mistake, calling for forgiveness and re-direction. ‘Sin’ is a mistranslation from the Greek ‘X’? which more accurately means ‘to miss the mark’. It is simply an error in direction, a mistake in judgment. In fact, the mistake IS judgment. Just like any archer firing an arrow, a footballer kicking a goal, a singer hitting a key, ‘hitting the mark’ requires practice. Relentless practice, if the level of proficiency is to be high. To hit the mark of peace, love and joy requires continual, patient practice of the untrained mind. Mistakes are inevitable. This is the process of forgiveness – forgiving our erroneous misthoughts until we no longer miss the mark.
The ego is bad.
God is not a He. God is not a She.. Correction: but there is value to calling It an It, and It a ‘He’. Forgiveness opportunity. And because we think we are human, we relate better to an anthropomorphization, a personality. Our current concept of love is body-based so it may be helpful to think of It as Him/Her. However, to insist that It is a Him/Her is to make a mistake. To insist that God be a She, for example, in response to millennia of patriarchal repression, is to make the same mistake as calling It a He.
God is not even an ‘It’. When we say ‘It’ we are talking as if ‘It’ is separate from us. Yet God 
Free will. We want to think free will is an issue of the world, whereas there is no free will in the world, really. Free will exists only in Heaven, and the choice for Heaven.
From…The world will be okay when you change what you believe.The world will work when you change what you do. To… The world will be okay when I change what I believe.
God did not create the world. God did not even create the Big Bang.
God has nothing to do with evolution
Atheism exists (ie. Everyone believes in God and “God” and gods)
Spiritual practice eventually means ascetism and going without stuff
The more I meditate, the better my spiritual practice
Morals are handed down by God or result from the genetic survival imperative. (They are expressions of metaphysical law. Ie. God won’t punish you for breaking the ten commandments or disavowing Jesus. Suffering is a self-imposed consequence of not understanding metaphysical mechanisms)
Consciousness does not have anything to do with God.
Evolution is not random. It is a diversionary tactic.
There is an intelligence in the Universe but it is not God.
All religions, sects, faiths, teachings have value. All have a role to play.
All religions, sects, faiths, teachings must ultimately be transcended.
God did not create religion.
What would proof of God look like?
Nothing in this world is true. Even this statement in this book.
Spirituality is about a change of mind, not changing the world.
Your actions in the world (ie. your behavior) reflect what you believe.
Belief is not knowledge. But it can lead to knowledge.
Faith is the bridge between belief and knowledge.
Religion is a truth-tool. Science is a truth-tool. Neither are the truth but both can help realise the truth.
Truth = God = absolute peace-joy-love-serenity
God cannot be defined and therefore cannot be proven. God can only be experienced.
All practice – spiritual, religious, scientific, artistic, mundane – is valuable if it promotes forgiveness, compassion and kindness.
Spiritual progress is measured by an increasing experience of peace, not by time spent meditating or healing modalities mastered.
God/Spirit is not energy.
The Bible is part true, part false, part misinterpretation, part misunderstanding, partly innocent, partly malevolent, partly unconscious, partly conscious.
Spirituality is the practice of one’s idea of oneself. Therefore, everyone is spiritual.
God deals out Karma. (No. The ego dishes out Karma, because it made need of karma)
Forgiveness - ego’s version versus Holy Spirit’s version
Sickness is not chosen at a conscious individual level. Anyone’s sickness is everyone’s call to healing themselves.
