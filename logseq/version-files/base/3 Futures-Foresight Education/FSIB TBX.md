	- Announcing the Solutions Challenge
	- On Friday 17th July, Koen Timmers, Co-founder of Take Action Global and one of our World Education Week partners, announced an exciting new addition to our World Education Week programme ‚Äì the T4 Solutions Challenge! üí•
	-
	- Watch the video to learn what this challenge for teachers involves AND to learn about the prizes that will be awarded! A copy of the video‚Äôs transcript is available below the video.

	- Transcript
	- Hi, this is Koen from Take Action Global and we all know about the huge impact T4 had a few weeks ago.
	-
	- When Vikas and I were brainstorming about the next edition, we couldn‚Äôt help ourselves but make an important connection to the best practices in classrooms, from across the world. And we all know that good education goes with problem-solving, taking action and even sharing those practices with peers in every corner of the world. And that‚Äôs why we decided to come up with something new, something very exciting, an action component!
	-
	- We want teachers globally to find a solution for a global issue. This can be poverty, climate change, gender inequality, or any other UN Sustainable Development Goal. But it has to involve SDG number 4 Quality Education.
	-
	- We want you to create a two-minute video which describes your solution through education. Next, you will need to promote your solution on social media, and through other channels, because the 100, most voted videos, they will be considered by a jury!
	-
	- Your deadline is 12th of September and we will be announcing the top three on September 28th. I am also happy to mention that you will not only receive infinite fame, but the winner will also go with $5000 US,  the first runner up will receive $3000 US, and the second runner up will go with $2000 US.!
	-
	- Make sure to submit your video at earthproject.org, and best of luck!
	-
	- The Solutions Challenge in summary
	- If you are a teacher, you are invited to submit a 2-minute video presenting a solution to a global issue.
	- Your solution can be about any of the UN Sustainable Development Goals but it must include SDG 4 Quality Education.
	- Your video must be in English and submitted to the Earth Project website.
	- Include a 200-word summary with your video.
	- Deadline for submitting: 12th September.
	- Once your video is on the site, please share your submission on the Earth Project website and ask your networks to vote for you.
	- Publication of the top 100 projects: 21st September
	- The 100 most popular videos will be reviewed by a jury.
	- The winner will receive $5000 US, the first runner up will receive $3000 US and the second runner up will receive $2000 US!
	- The 3 winners will be announced on 28th September.
	- To learn more, visit the Solutions Challenge page on the Earth Project website.

- Is this the future we want?
- Quick fixes over hard work
- Teachers and coaches are often critical of students‚Äô and trainees desire for the short cut
-
- Education activists, administrators and academics implore us to develop critical, creative, higher-order thinking in our students and their approach to thinking and learning. Yet are we practicing that ourselves in our solutions towards the world‚Äôs problems.
- Worshipping our solutions
- Is this part of the problem?

- A tool is only useful when its used in the right way, the right time, for the right purpose by the right person.
- Most "solutions" here will be "technological" in nature.
- Maybe a few systemic proposals.
-
-
- My proposal is no different - its usefulness, its ‚Äúsolution-ness‚Äù will depend on how its used.
-
- The future is constantly misused and abused.
-
- Or rather, its never misused but its underlying deeper purpose is not made apparent - it is consciously but more often unconsciously, kept hidden.
-
-
- What is quality education when the problems of the world are made by the "educated"?
- What is "expertise" when "experts" often preside over many problems.
- Storyboard
- R. Buckminster Fuller quotes
- There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you its going to be a butterfly.
- You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a model that makes the old model obsolete.
- Quite clearly our task is predominantly metaphysical, for it is how to get all of humanity to educate itself enough to generate spontaneous social behaviours that will avoid extinction.
- We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims.
- A fool with a tool still remains a fool.

- ...is my problem is bigger than yours

- Everyone is already a futurist. Let's develop these skills explicitly.
- Futures Studies and Strategic Foresight is already an academic discipline at universities and within business. We can make it a core competency!
- Tech is not the answer because tech is not the goal. It is part of the answer if used the right way. It depends on the purpose, the aspiration, the vision.
- Part 4 - Myths & Misconceptions around FF
- You are already teaching a particular future, embedded in the curriculum and embodied by your practice. Whose preferred future is this? Yours? Your students'? The government's? The World Economic Forum? World Bank? Neoliberal capitalists? Green marxists? Luddite conservative? ZuckerBezos Techno-utopia?

- The nature of problems
- Problems are facilitated by the educated
- What the problem is depends on who you ask
- The toolbox defines the problem
- Shifting the problem versus solving the problem
- Inconvenient solutions
- Require hard work
- The resistance is where the solution is
- The blind spot hides the real problem, the deeper problem
-
-
- Today's solution is tomorrow's problem
- ‚Ä¶if there is no temporal dimension
- foresight
- holistic
-
-
-
- For whom is it a problem? A priority?
- Not wanting to see the real problem
- Current dominant socio-economics rewards problems without genuine solutions
- Examples of questions FF would ask and aspects FF would treat
- Everyone wants a better world...as they see it
- Tech has become the goal in itself, rather than one piece of the puzzle.

- Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself.
- Alvin Toffler
- Note re Concept Mapping for this TBX document
- I want to create a concept map at each level of work in order to visualise the relationships and purpose of each element. I want to see how they fit together and why I am doing that particular task.
- To do this I use the existing map containers *at that level* of map along with the Driving Questions and Goals, Objectives, Aims of each of the elements. (These DQs and GOAs would be contained within the element, and therefore are 1 level down in terms of the TBX outline levels.)
- New attributes may need to be defined at each mapping level and set to ‚Äòtrue‚Äô in order for an agent to create and collect these aliases and map them. For example, at the top level, ‚ÄòisFFLcmap‚Äô is the mapping attribute. Within the ‚ÄòFSIB PhD‚Äô container, a ‚ÄòisFSIBphdCmap‚Äô attribute may need to be created and set, and so on.
- Within each enterprise/project/container, there must be Driving Questions (DQs) and Goals, Objectives, Aims (GOAs). These are essential to the map.

- ie. If we used a farming metaphor, what sort of farm would your school be? What would be the diet(curriculum) your farm favours or serves?
- For a factory metaphor, what sort of factory?
- Cheap labour, repetitive tasks, time-pressured
- A production line?
-
- But I‚Äôm not stopping at metaphor. In exploring the metaphor, I am simultaneously exploring the factories(work), fishing/farming (food) and finance (resources) systems of the future.
- Then, perhaps (though I need to think this through more carefully) I am also critiquing these future techs/systems, or alternatively, providing a warning of what features must they incorporate. (I‚Äôm not sure how this critique will happen/arise yet)

- Paper A designs the course(s). It does not critique, though it may report others‚Äô critiques of yet other proposals. It uses the statements of authoring/proposing/governing entities themselves and shows how FS meets these ie. FSSF ticks your boxes.
-
- Paper A does NOT address the question of ‚Äú‚Ä¶then why not just follow the program offered by Z in Proposal X?‚Äù It avoid this. Instead, it might show how each of their goals & methods conflict. Paper A does NOT show how Proposal X does not really meet the needs of the future or its quoted needs.

- Paper A may need to address the question: What are our priorities then? We can‚Äôt do all of whay team P, Q and R are proposing? Which should we prioritize?

- Paper A - Designing a Futures Studies subject for the IB Diploma Program
- Objective:
- Use this article to help design FSSF-sbs for IBDP, and document the process.
-
- I could contrast the requirements of IBDP/IBO with other curricula.
-
- I could investigate how IBO looks on industry input, and what these industrial players are saying
-
- In the process of designing FSSF-sbs, I can also design FFL-ATAR and FFEE. These could be other papers (spin-offs), using the groundwork of this paper. I might even mention this paper.
-
- I could even structure it with possible other goals in mind ie. subjects for other systems:
- IBCP (career program)
- QCAA
- NSW/VIC
- UK
- NZ
- Malaysia, Taiwan, India
-
- Rationale is cursory, concise, shallow.
- Rationale only insofar as to support directives of the curricula.
-
-
- Use latest Curriculum Theory to inform design of FSSF course
- Use Futures frameworks and models to inform design of FSSF course and textbook
- Conversely, use recent ed trends/developements to augment FFL programs
- Generate spectrum/matrix of FFL opportunities for various curricula
- Create scenarios/typology/spectrum/matrix of FSSF courses for various systems
- Teach teachers some Futures techniques through articles
- Explore existing Futures Education & FFL programs
- this includes FFL already implicitly embedded in programs/curricula
-
- tertiary and corporate
-
-
- Determine key concepts, ideas and understandings of a Futures subject
- How does each system/proposal determine what the key concepts are and/or prioritize the importance of ideas and understandings.

- ie. If we used a farming metaphor, what sort of farm would your school be? What would be the diet(curriculum) your farm favours or serves?
- For a factory metaphor, what sort of factory?
- Cheap labour, repetitive tasks, time-pressured
- A production line?
-
- But I‚Äôm not stopping at metaphor. In exploring the metaphor, I am simultaneously exploring the factories(work), fishing/farming (food) and finance (resources) systems of the future.
- Then, perhaps (though I need to think this through more carefully) I am also critiquing these future techs/systems, or alternatively, providing a warning of what features must they incorporate. (I‚Äôm not sure how this critique will happen/arise yet)

- Then, perhaps (though I need to think this through more carefully) I am also critiquing these future techs/systems, or alternatively, providing a warning of what features must they incorporate. (I‚Äôm not sure how this critique will happen/arise yet)

- Explore metaphors of Education such as Fishing, Farming, Factories, Finance
- eg. Teach a man to fish, factory schooling
-
- But, also use these as:
- a) actual models eg. factory schooling, factory farming
- b) actual topics/issues for study that are increasingly important

- Paper 5 - Textbook of the Future
- Paper 6 - Implementation of FSSF-SBS in the classroom
- GOAs of doing a PhD in FFL
- To guide and document the development of FSSFsbs
- I need to/should know what went on before (eg. Slaughter/O‚ÄôRourke and Corinda) and what is going on now (Teach the Future, Bishop/Hines et al.)
-
- To have external "authority" to teach something more meaningful at school - FSSF
- To have credibility to train teachers in teaching FSSF
- To open up opportunities down the track eg. University work
- To develop FSSF subject and justify its implementation
- To train an army of thinkers
- To learn Futures thinking and Futures tools myself
- My contentions, assertions, propositions and theses:
- A structured futures studies course in a structured program such as IBDP, QCAA sate, A-levels etc is a) a necessary step forward b) a helfpul step forward c) a transitionary step, between old knowledge structures and new knowledge structure (see Gidley Megatrends of Mind, evolution of consciousness, education for radical change). It acknowledges internal and not just external.
- FSSF is the ideal tool to create lifelong learners
- Futures can be taught in the style of out-dated traditional Factory model. OR it can be taught in ways that reflect the future aspirations of the student and society. There are a spectrum of FSSF scenarios, which reflect the spectrum of society's ideas of their future.
- 21CT has inherent contradictions about the future
- Futures & Foresight Literacy is an essential, missing element in contemporary education. Futures Literacy must not only feature in the toolbox of Future Literacies, it must guide and temper the choice of "Future Literacies". The choice of "Future Literacies" is determined by our views of the future.
- Contrast Futures Literacy against Future Literacies
- FSSF meets the criteria for deep learning, higher order thinking and is perfectly suited for project-based learning, inquiry-learning etc.
- FSSF is a vastly improved vehicle for 21st Century Skills
- FSSF IB SBS and its cousins is helpful and necessary for modern students.
- FSSF is a transitionary step between old knowledge structures and new knowledge structures (see Gidley, Megatrends of the Mind.)
- Deep Learning does not really promote qualitative growth as much as FFL does.
- ...but what is Deep Learning for? (Or HOT, or STEM, or 21CT)
- An FFL culture in schools and education systems enhances educational outcomes for all
- Education... OF the future, ABOUT the future, FOR the future, BY/WITH the future
- IF education is for the future, and the future is a)moving b)moving quickly c)moving quickly, more quickly d)characterised by large ramifications e) common to everyone as a concept f)lifelong...then, why don't we teach the future?
- There needs to be a subject/course which explicitly teaches the educational imperatives states ie. integrated transdisciplinarity, futures-orientation, higher-order problem solving, holism & depth, life-long learning, 4A's
- If not an FSSF subject, then each subject should have an FFL component to temper, balance, deepen, make more rigorous and resilient each subject's work
- If...But...And therefore...With...Yet...While... Then Why don't we teach Futures and Foresight Literacy?

- 2.3 Research Questions
- 2.3.1 Research questions
- Can be divided into Design, Rationale, Delivery‚Ä¶but remember! that these are not independent but inter-dependent:
-
- Why determines what.
- The what requires a certain how. Or, how facilitates the what.
-
- What is limited/defined by how and why?
- How is determined by what and why?
-
- Rationale FFL - Why should FFL be taught?
- Reasons
- Imperatives
- Goals
-
- Why is the foundation. What and How build on this. So it should come first.
-
- Quick answer: Because each program says (more or less) that we either need to chagne, prepare for the future, prepare for uncertainty, changing job landscape etc
- ie. teach for this (their) future. But‚Ä¶
- a) its not explicit
- b) it preferences a particular future, or narrow set of futures
- c) its likely to be inaccurate to a significant degree
- d) its not really novel, at the deeper level
-
- What is the state of the world that education is embedded in?
- What is the Future of Education?
- 2 parts:
- Historical literature review - not novel
- Update this for 2020 by looking at recent developments
-
- Proposition: The 2020 status isn‚Äôt that much different. Still the same underlying stuff.
- Or: We have made developments, but this FFL is how it could be improved (given its own directives of ‚Äúpreparing for the future‚Äù.)
-
- This question looks at the RATIONALE for explicitly teaching FSSF. Its addressing will show the need for explicit FSSF, i can argue.
-
- Emerging issues analysis?
- Integral analysis?
- CLA?
- What are the trends and scenarios?
- Of secondary education
- Of tertiary education influencing secondary
- Of youth
- Global world trends influencing education
- What says what about trends/future?
- What are the models? Programs? Initiatives?
- What are the goals of education proposed by these models? Explicit. Implicit.
- What are the purposes of education within these?
- How does the Future of Work relate to the Future of Education?
- Since work and education so strongly linked these days
- How do/did I select who/what to analyse?

-
-
- Is it possible to design and deliver a Futures Studies course within the IBDP?
- What do I even mean by this question? Of course it is possible? But what would make it ‚Äúpermissible‚Äù, ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù, ‚Äúprobable‚Äù, ‚Äúattractive‚Äù?
-
- The GOA‚Äôs, as stated in their own terms ie. Does it nominally agree with their objectives?

- The bulk of this won‚Äôt be new. But i am updating to include latest proposals.
- Why would an FSSF course be advantageous? Of benefit? Even essential?

-
- What do/should/could FFL activities look like?

- Insight!
- I need to approach creation of FSSF-sbs as if I were creating a science subject.
- FF easily lends itself to humanities. That side will emerge much more easily.
- I need to approach design with the thought:
- This could the student‚Äôs only Science subject. What should they learn? What lab work and field work should/could they undertake?
- Similarly, this could be the student‚Äôs only Humanities subject: What should they learn?

- Feedback and Comms with Robin Julian and IBO
- Letter to Robin Julian re moving forward with FSIB-SBS
- Dear Robin,
-
- It is with great excitement and anticipation that I can now reply to our early email thread about Futures Studies & Strategic Foresight SBS proposal.
-
- My school, Mountian Creek State High School, has whole-heartedly endorsed the idea. In more helpful detail, the idea has been unanimously adopted by the Executive Leadership group at the recent Strategic Review meeting, approved by the School Council, and endorsed by the Parents & Citizens Association.
-
- In fact, the school shares my view and value of this idea and wants me to extend the study of Futures & Foresight beyond the IB-SBS into our majority student population which pursues the ATAR Queensland government curriculum. This will be done via 1-hour per week class for Year 11‚Äôs and 12‚Äôs, as well as a dedicated introductory subject for Year 10‚Äôs, inspired by IB principles and meeting general and interdisciplinary ACARA criteria.
-
- This may not be optimal timing for this email given COVID-19 impacts and adjustments. However, this very pandemic and its socio-economic consequences adds greater justification for why this subject should be studied. Futures-oriented researchers and thinkers have been talking about ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù as an inevitable scenario for a long time. Now, government and the general public will, or should, adjust their thinking for future events, not just contagion.
-
- I look forward to hearing back from you at your convenience as to next steps and where to from here, and how.
-
- Kind regards,

-
- Many contemporary programs and initiatives claim to be future-focused in some way. All parties and systems hold some kind of artefact of the future, if only implicit. It is the nature of Futures Studies to map and critically analyse these many, often competing, claims around the future and generate authentic alternatives. It is the role of Strategic Foresight to use proactively anticipate issues and events in order to make more effective decisions in the present.

- Outline the nature of the proposed SBS
-
- The essence of Futures Studies and Strategic Foresight is to use robust theories, concepts and methodologies of Futures and Foresight to enable better decision-making in the present. All individuals and organizations already use ideas around ‚Äòthe future‚Äô for this general purpose, with varying degrees of success and unintended consequences. It is the purpose of FSSF to make the study and use of the future explicit, considered, rigorous and systematic rather than implicit, unconscious, superficial and haphazard.
- a toolbox of futures and foresight tools, in conjunction with knowledge of contemporary important and emerging issues, to enable better decision making in the present.
-
- The future can consist of 2 basic types of artefacts. Not strictly a ‚Äòtime‚Äô, the future exists as an idea or thought of what we think may unfold or (not) want to unfold, and the means to accomplish this. Plans, predictions, hypotheses, forecasts, strategies, scenarios, visions, dreams fall into this category, as do grand patterns, timeless stories, myth and metaphor.
- The future may also consist of ‚Äòsignals‚Äô from the future in the form of data and trends. While they do temporally and physically exist in the present, they are yet to be considered conventional or as an opportunity or threat, and remain on the fringe of acceptance and/or implementation.
- Having foresight involves identifying these issues and trends, the proposed responses, and critically assessing them and their possible consequences.
-
- One could argue that if we study the past then should we not also study the future? Just as the study of history involves taking multiple perspectives, calls for reinterpretation in the light of new facts, and is constrained by its tools and methodologies, FSSF
-
- In describing the nature of FSSF, it is helpful to consider what it is as well as what it is not.

- For example,
- Physics: energy production, quantum computing, death of the universe
- Maths: extrapolation, probability, modelling
- English: myth and metaphor, images of the future, alternative histories

- *these can be found in subject guides of relevant existing DP subjects
- (Please do not just list the aims.)
-
- As such, FSSF meets all six Group 3 aims.
-
- FSSF will draw heavily on a range of ‚Äúschools‚Äù of futures thinking: predictive-empirical, interpretive, critical and integral & transdisciplinary. This is in order to offer the full power of a futures-orientation and appreciate the diversity and depth of values, views and variables across technological, environmental, socio-economic, geopolitical and cultural systems.
-
- FSSF is predicated on the view there is no one single future, but a spectrum of possible, plausible and probable futures in which is embedded an organization‚Äôs or individual‚Äôs preferred futures.
-
- 1. Encourage the systematic study of possible, plausible, probable and preferred futures, including the worldviews and myths that underlie them, across a range of physical space, intellectual domain and time scale.
-
- 2. Develop skills in critical futuring, creative foresight and change management to map and anticipate emerging issues, analyse and evaluate proposed responses, generate alternatives, and implement strategy.
-
- 3. Collect, describe, analyse and interpret data around emerging issues and trends, forecasts and scenarios across a range of domains, disciplines and time scales.
-
- 4. Promote the appreciation of futures-oriented learning as a balance and counterpoint to past-oriented learning, and how this learning is culturally bound and variant.
-
- 5. Develop an awareness in the student of the panoply of future possibility beyond those of the student‚Äôs institutions of origin, and that study of the future behooves not only appreciation of this diversity but the presence of ‚Äòblind spots‚Äô and filters in everyone.
-
- 6. Assist the student to appreciate and manage the uncertainty of the future, recognizing that claims and methodologies of futures are contestable, and that their study facilitates the power to adapt to this uncertainty and the possibility to envision and enact alternatives.
-
- 4. Promote the appreciation of

-
-
- Students will be able to gather, interpret and evaluate data from varied sources around forecasts and projected futures
-
- enable students to employ futures frameworks to critically and sensitively analyse future-oriented texts such as policy documents, business plans, techno-economic modelling, scenario outlines, technology roadmaps, organizational strategy, stories of alternative history, science fiction and utopia/dystopia, and visionary art, music and literature.
-
- enable students to apply tools and methods to generate alternative and preferred futures, considering consequences and evaluating impacts across diverse stakeholders.
-
- understand that while the future is characterised by uncertainty, one can appreciate grand patterns through history and across domain and apply models of change to strategic foresight activities
-
- encourage students to use their knowledge of futures issues and practical foresight skills to offer insights to a specified stakeholder or end-user.
-
- appreciate the multi-disciplinary, inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary nature and benefits of futures approaches to knowledge
- https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/grad5104/multiintertrans-disciplinary-whats-the-difference/
- https://www.arj.no/2012/03/12/disciplinarities-2/
-
- appreciate that contemporary complex issues and problems may consist of layers, aspects and degrees, and that solutions and responses benefit from acknowledging this scale and scope.

-
-
- How will the syllabus embed the IB learner profile¬†?
- By adopting critical, integral, transdisciplinary futures approaches, NOT stopping at predictive-forecasting, FSSF becomes a reliable vehicle for the IB Learner Profile. Since there is always a future, as well as something of interest or need, students become inquisitive throughout life. They become knowledgeable about a range of pressing issues across space and time, including the timeless and universal. FSSF encourages students to question ethics and investigate value systems in formulating action steps on complex problems. It allows them to anticipate consequences and thus take greater responsibility for actions. Being committed to alternative futures and intepretations of histories, FSSF fosters an open-mind and appreciation of other value systems. And being goal-oriented and values driven, FSSF is service-oriented, while being reflective of success-failure, as well as biases and blind spots. The very essence of FSSF is the ‚Äúapproach to uncertainty with forethought‚Äù as well as ‚Äúnew ideas and innovation‚Ä¶in the face of challenges and change.‚Äù

- CAS
- CAS is already implicitly oriented towards the future: students hold an image of a preferred future in mind and seek to enact and enable it through service and action in the community. We could consider this Higher-Order Futures Thinking. FSSF will support CAS by offering a toolbox of foresight skills and change management principles, as well as topic knowledge, in order to make the CAS process more rigorous and effective.

- While not part of this EOI and initial scope of the FSSF-SBS, it is envisaged that FSSF offers one rigorous means to extend and/or unite CAS into an Extended Essay.
-
- FSSF is goal-based, action-oriented and values driven, and thus committed to serving the broader community. CAS supports FSSF by stimulating inquiry in a field of interest through a real-world project. CAS projects are essentially about making a difference and realising a preferred future. Through implementing its theories and techniques, FSSF supports CAS by guiding CAS direction and helping make projects more rigorous and effective.
-
-
- How will the syllabus embed IB Approaches to teaching and learning?
- FSSF embeds IB ATL by taking an inquiry-driven and conceptually-based approach, built on truly ‚ÄúBig Questions‚Äù and universal principles tailored to a student‚Äôs context. These are individually relevant in each student‚Äôs context, while  As such, FSSF is both differentiated through preferred futures and ways of learning and knowing. Social, collaboration as well as self-management skills are developed through encouraging personal responsibility for learning as well as their lives and world. FSSF incorporates a systems approach acknowledging complexity and emergence, but also looks at the worldviews, myths and metaphors underlying each.
-
- in the understanding that we don‚Äôt, and can‚Äôt, act and live alone. Our actions-consequences intertwine
-
- What exactly are IB ATL?
- 5 approaches to Learning:
- Developing thinking skills
- Social skills
- Communication skills
- Self-management skills
- Research skills
-
- 6 approaches to Teaching:
- Inquiry-based
- Conceptually-focused
- Contextualized
- Collaborative
- Differentiated
- Informed by assessment
-
- OF
- ABOUT
- FOR
- BY
- TO/WITH
-
-
- not only how we teach, but what we teach.
- Not only what we teach, but who defines what we should know for the future ( eg. WEF)
- ‚ÄúFutures of Education‚Äù have conventionally fallen into two categories. Either they are focused on how to teach for the future: increased use of technology, flipped classrooms, blended learning, ‚Äú21st Century skills‚Äù, ‚Äúdeep‚Äù learning, project-based learning etc. Or, alternatively, if discussing the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù, they privelige a particular vision of the future and emphasise preferred trends to define the required content to ‚Äúsucceed in the future‚Äù. This has lead to heavy and rapid investment in STEM programs, coding and robotics, in terms of content, that will lead to ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in the (prescribed) future.
-
- FSSF seeks to find a balanced, middle ground of trend, innovation, and wisdom, informed by criticality, reflection and introspection.
-
- In addition to contemporary ‚Äúliteracy‚Äù initiatives such as scientific/STEM literacy, digital/ICT literacy, media literacy et al, FSSF promotes Futures and Foresight Literacy: the capacity to read and write the future, critically and creatively.
-
- in addition to orthodox contemporary literacy movements: language literacy, numeracy, scientific literacy, digital/ICT literacy,
-
- Teachers of learners AND teachers of content
- Students meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry with greater critical and creative thinking
- Promote aims of subjects (making more than just aspirations) while linking previously isolated knowledge
- A variety of skills that will equip them for learning beyond school and success beyond tertiary education
- Enhance the coherence and relevance of students‚Äô DP experience
- Blend of idealism and practicality
- Ôøº
-
- What are IB ATLs?
- How will the syllabus foster ‚Äòinternational mindedness‚Äô?
- FSSF fosters international-mindedness in many ways. By considering global issues, their local effects and regional responses, FSSF looks at the variety of ways the future is viewed across the world. Many contemporary problems have consequences beyond borders and call for trans-national co-operation given their scope and magnitude. FSSF considers not only national and international futures but those held by cultural groups which also don‚Äôt obey nation-state boundaries. Globalization is recognized as a massive trend making IM central to the FSSF subject. Furthermore, alternative ways of knowing the future and understanding time beyond modern Western, techno-economic models are explored.
-
- recognizes that globalization is a strong driver of world systems, and these systems are increasingly interconnected in their operation and consequences.
-
- discusses futures of nation-state, ideas around it,
- discusses alternative notions of culture and groupings rather than the nation-state
-
- emerging issues - watching the world, not just local
-
- alternative ways of knowing  the future
- different models and modes of time eg. indian vs pacific vs western
- macrohistorical models of time
-
- not only how different nations define issues and craft responses, but how different cultures
-
- redefines culture
- How does IB define IM?
- How do others define IM?
- How does Futures define something like IM?
- Outline of syllabus content, emphasising a conceptual approach, and including a statement explaining its relevance to the programme group.
- (Coverage in appropriate depth should be possible in 150 hours.)
-
- FSSF draws on the academic discipline of Foresight and Future Studies as well as the gems from other Group 3 subjects.
-
- FSSF draws on the conceptually-based ‚Äúthree element frameworks‚Äù found in other IBDP Group 3 subjects.
-
- 3 strands with student & stakeholders at the centre
- Big questions and significant ideas
- Key concepts
-
- FSSF draws from the relatively young academic discipline of Foresight and Future Studies as well as models from other Group 3 subjects. It employs an integrated three-element framework which can also be found in subjects such as Global Politics (People-Power-Politics; Theoretical Foundations, Levels of Analysis and Individual & Group Perspectives), ITGS (the three strands) and History (Content-Concepts-Skills). It also adopts ‚ÄúBig Questions, Key Concepts and Significant Ideas‚Äù similar to Environmental Systems and Societies.
- The 3 strands of FSSF are as follows:
- 1.	The SHAPE of the Future: Science, History, Art, Philosophy and Education of Futures and Foresight. ‚ÄòShape‚Äô is used here in two ways. One, as a catchy umbrella acronym outlining the strand‚Äôs intentions of looking at the various ways the future may be investigated, treated and expressed.
-
-
- System of ‚Äòthrees‚Äô
-
- ESS:
-
- GP core: People, power, politics and
- Theoretical Foundations, Levels of Analysis, and Individual and Group Perspectives
-
- ITGS: 3 strands of
- Strand 1: Social and Ethical Significance
- Strand 2: Application to specified scenarios
- Strand 3: IT Systems
-
- Student | Stakeholders at the centre
- Outline of assessment, including an explanation of the connection with the relevant subject group's assessment objectives, and also an explanation of how assessment conforms with the school‚Äôs IB Diploma Programme assessment policy.
- FSSF intends to align with the Group 3 assessment objectives and methods by modelling after other Group 3 subjects.
-
- Assessment will consist of 2 external exam papers and an Internal Assessment. Indicative weightings could be Paper 1 - 40%, Paper 2 -  40% and IA - 20%, though I would also like to explore the possibility of weighting the IA more heavilty. For example, Paper 1 - 30%, Paper 2 - 30%, IA - 40%.
-
- The Internal Assessment would be a futures and foresight analysis on an issue or question of personal interest or local significance. The treatment should meet a required level of specificity, locality and particularity and should not have been covered in detail within the syllabus. The IA would possess both a critical-analytical element as well as a creative-alternatives element. Students will be required to identify and analyse existing treatments, assessments or representations of the futures issue. Using futures tools and methodologies, including those which may not have been covered in the course, students are then to generate alternatives to the futures investigated. These futures may then be expressed in a number of ways, leveraging the student‚Äôs preferred means of expression. These may include but are not limited to:
- art piece: drawing,
- creative writing: short story, newspaper article, album lyrics
- movie/drama script
- mathematical/biophysical modelling
- survey and statistical analysis
- scientific-style report
- web site, multimedia production
- alternative historical timeline
- business plan, corporate/marketing strategy
- infographic, data visualization dashboard
- foresight exercise with report for local organization
-
- An exegetic report component must be included clearly and explicitly communicating the futures analysis and interpretations embedded in the work.
-
- 2 exams?
- IA
- Multimedia
- Exegesis
- Foresight case study
- Analysis of Proposed Futures; critique
- Creation of alternatives
- Art, story, plan, scenarios, choose-your-own adventure,

- What resources are in place or planned to support teaching and learning for this SBS?
- ASOT, HOT and Collins
-
- Sohail, son did IBDP at Mountain Creek
- Marcus, USC - Grad Dip futures; university connection
-
- Rick Slaughter as friendly advisor, former teacher/designer of only known secondary course/subject in Futures
-
-
- Resources - from Letter to Darrin
- There exists an extensive repository of resources to draw material and support from for the FSSF-SBS, covering a range of sources and diversity of type.
- Within the Futures and Foresight community there is a strong educational thrust as they recognize, perhaps better than anyone, that youth are the future, and the future is fundamentally about learning.
-
- I will draw on the resources of this academic community, in conjunction with the IBO, to design and deliver FSSF-SBS. This includes the curricula and teaching staff of the various tertiary Futures & Foresight subjects, courses and diplomas around the world, and the insights and experiences of Futures ‚Äòpracademia‚Äô in working with the corporate world.
-
- For example, a selection of pedagogical Futures & Foresight text resources might include:
- Questioning the Future: Methods and Tools for Organizational and Societal Transformation, Sohail Inayatullah
- Foundations of Futures Studies, Wendell Bell
- Teaching About the Future, Peter Bishop and Andy Hines
- Futures Thinking for Social Foresight, Richard Slaughter with Marcus Bussey
- What works: Case Studies in the Practice of Foresight by Sohail Inayatullah
- Foresight: The Art and Science of Anticipating the Future by Denis Loveridge
-
- Various peer-reviewed journals are available to draw on as well. Looking at only my current library, there is an array of both futures-focused journals as well as those of other disciplines which address the future. These include:
- Journal of Futures Studies
- Technological Forecasting and Social Change
- The Futurist
- World Future Review
- Futures
- European Journal of Futures Research
- Foresight
- On the Horizon
-
- This is complemented by futures & foresight articles appearing in a range of other journals:
- Journal of Teacher Education for Sustainability
- Journal of Peace Education
- American Behavioural Scientist
- Computers & Education
- Procedia - Social and Behavioural Sciences
- International Journal of Management Education
- Energy Policy
- Physics Today
- ‚Ä¶and many more
-
- Professional foresight practitioners and others futures-oriented professionals organise around many professional associations. Most of these have educational outreach arms. I‚Äôm confident they would be very interested in some kind of collaboration with an IBDP FSSF-SBS and/or creating a ‚Äústudent‚Äù category of membership similar to other professional bodies.
- World Future Society
- World Futures Studies Federation
- Institute for the Future
- The Millennium Project
- Association of Professional Futurists
-
- In terms of content, FSSF can draw on anything and everything that is available to the school, its teachers and its students: free web content, newspapers, story books, movies and documentaries, local council policy documents, existing textbooks and general library resources will all offer opportunities to investigate the future. However, to suggest some specific  specific resources which might be included are
- UN Sustainable Development Goals
- The Big History Project
- Teach The Future foundation
- UNESCO Future Literacy Labs
- ‚Ä¶ and many more.
-
- Pedagogically, I anticipate drawing on UNESCO‚Äôs growing work in Futures and Foresight Literacy evidenced by their nomination of 8 Chairs in Anticipation, Futures Literacy and Futures Studies, based at various Universities and institutions around the world. Should the FSSF-SBS go ahead, I see great potential for collaboration with UNESCO‚Äôs Global Futures Literacy Network.
-
- In fact, I am fortunate to have Professor Sohail Inayatullah, the UNESCO Chair in Futures Studies, as my MA/PhD co-supervisor. Professor Inayatullah is a UNESCO Chair in Futures Studies and holds positions at USC, Tamkang University (Taiwan), Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia and the Melbourne Business School. Not only a theoretician, Prof. Inayatullah consults on futures and foresight with organizations around the world such as Interpol, Asian Development Bank, UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Rural Health Victoria, Disability Queensland, and the Governments of Malaysia, Pakistan, Armeania, China, Singapore and New Zealand, to name but a few.  Furthermore, Prof. Inayatullah has links to our school as children were students of MCSHS. His son, Saim Inayatullah completed the IBDP in 2011, giving Prof. Inayatullah a unique appreciation of the IB and the role FSSF can play. My other supervisor is Dr Marcus Bussey, Deputy Head, School of Social Sciences at USC. He is a former school teacher and ran the USC Graduate Certificate in Futures Studies.
-
- The development of the FSSF-SBS will serve as a vehicle for my MA/PhD studies through our local university , the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC), with whom my school already collaborates quite closely. In doing so, the SBS course development is given additional academic rigour and oversight. It also strengthens secondary-tertiary-community collaboration and leverages existing expertise and resources.
-
- My research will help inform the development of the necessary elements of the FSSF-SBS: curriculum, syllabus, teacher resources, student resources, suggested learning sequences and activities. I will compare and contrast the various approaches to teaching the future. A significant effort will be in framing, positioning and delivering the wealth of futures literature in a way suitable for a secondary school audience. Furthermore, my research will update the existing futures education literature for the 21st Century, re-emphasising the need in the Anthropocene for explicit, systematic, critical, holistic treatment of futures, and proactive and reflective use of anticipation and foresight. I intend to highlight the significant gap in preparing for the future that exists in secondary education - that of cultivating Futures and Foresight Literacy - and how the IBO is perfectly positioned to fill that gap and meet that imperative. Lastly, I hope to gather empirical data on the implementation of FSSF-SBS including its effects on the sense of preparedness and hope students feel.
-
- Another significant human resource is the wisdom and experience of Dr Richard Slaughter, a groundbreaking Futures and Foresight pracademic in the South-East Queensland region. Dr Slaughter is largely retired from academic life but has agreed to meet with me at his home in Brisbane. Dr Slaughter was the designer and educator of two innovative Futures thinking education initiatives. First was the Queensland Board of Senior Secondary School Studies, Pre-Pilot Senior Syllabus in Futures. Sadly, this course was discontinued for political-bureaucratic reasons rather than student interest or effectiveness. (See Slaughter RA. Futures education: catalyst for our times. Journal of Futures Studies. 2008;12:15-30.) Later, Dr Slaughter designed, established and taught the early years of the Master of Strategic Foresight at Swinburne University in Melbourne. He has co-authored books and articles with Dr Bussey, my co-supervisor, who assures me he will be interested in consulting in some way.
-
- I have plans to broaden the FSSF network further by actively reaching out to potential international collaborators. I will be arranging to visit Dr Peter Bishop, former Director of the graduate program in Futures Studies at the University of Houston, on my way to family holidays in Colombia in December 2020. In addition, should the EoI be accepted by the IBO, I shall be applying to present at an international conference: ‚ÄòLearning Futures ‚Äì Futures of Learning‚Äô, the 21st International Futures Conference of the Finland Futures Research Centre and Finland Futures Academy of the University of Turku in June 2020.

- Improved ability to "Other": space, time, person
- An increasing interest and need for futures focus
- Invite teachers of specialist discplines to discussion.
- Teachers unprepared. Students ask probing questions.
- Teachers prepared with ideas and information.
- History of new subjects in IB
- Process
- Criteria
- General benefits of FS over drive/need for a new subject.
- A general oblique reference to FS as existing, practised, taught subjects in high schools and universities, without going into explicit need for FSIB.
- A discussion about a specific, formal FSIB course could emerge.
- Action learning approach to course design - dynamic, iterative, personalised
- Students design and create the course, not just for themselves but for future students
-
- Students could create texts (video, presentations, essays) which serve as:
- a) reading for the next cohort
- b) assessment for themselves
- c) a basis/trigger/fuel for an assessment piece for next cohort (ie. a reference, a critique)
-
- Builds a knowledge base?
- Rebalancing: From an era of specialization, shifting back towards some generalization, or at least, inter-disciplinary literacy
- Polymaths are dead. But futurists can prosper.
- Driving Questions (specific to FSIBsbs)
- What is the procedure for IB-SBS?
- What are comparative examples? ESS?
- How could FSIBsbs integrate with other subjects? EE? CAS? ToK? Complement them?
- What are assessment requirements for IBDP?
- GOA's FSSFsbs
- To develop an IB school-based subject in FSSF which I can teach at school
- To develop the subject I wish I could have studied at school
- To develop the subject that I believe needs teaching at school
- To develop a subject which abides by: OF/ABOUT/FOR/BY
- To develop FSSF subject with FSSF characteristics
- To develop 4 scenarios of FSSF subject, with varying degrees of characteristics
- 1. Conventional
-
-
- 4. Student-led, teacher
-
-
- One axis of matrix is ‚Äústudent-teacher driven‚Äù
-
- Other could be:
- Conventional assessment - novel assessment
-
- Project-based learning
- Personalised learning
- Deep Learning
- Critical Thinking
- Creative Thinking
- Inquiry Learning
- Passion project
- To develop an FSSF subject which can be taught on-line
- To export the FSSF subject and train teachers
- FSSFsbs provides practical context and application of skills
- to personal lives and plans
- to professional pathways
- Students choose to investigate futures via a particular vocation
- interview someone
- review journals etc

- This could be a sequel to Futures Literacy vs Futures Literacies: making the future explicit.
- FsL vs FLs is broad, introduces the idea of FFL, identifies players
- QL vs DL provides a macro-metaphor, expands conversation (eg. to spirituality while providing an example of FsL vs FFL)

- Curriculum Innovation: Futures & Foresight
-
- MCSHS is leading the educational curve, as well as community and national capacity building, by electing to develop and include Futures & Foresight programs into its curriculum. As explicit subjects dedicated to studying the future, these will be world firsts.
-
- In 2022, MCSHS will introduce a Year 10 Futures & Foresight subject available to all students bound for both ATAR and IB pathways. To soon begin formal development is the subject Futures Studies and Strategic Foresight offered as part of the IB Diploma Program beginning in 2023. The existing senior subject, currently known as ‚ÄúATAR‚Äù and ‚ÄúNATAR‚Äù will also have futures thinking injected to provide coherence, relevance and competence for students‚Äô futures.
-
- These subjects will develop students 21st Century Skills as well as the 5 Aspects of Futures Competencies: Adaptation, Anticipation, Agency, Alignment and Alternatives.  Students will undertake a holistic, deep, interdisciplinary treatment of the future by investigating such things as significant trends (eg. climate change), emerging issues (eg. ethics of AI), as well as universal and timeless patterns, while developing the skills to engage in critical and creative futuring. The full spectrum of life shall be included: Society, Technology, Economics, Environment, Politics, Law, Ethics (STEEPLE).
-
- Funding would greatly assist this educational innovation be a success and accelerate its propagation within and beyond the school.
-
- $20,000 is requested across 2020 and 2021 for two primary purposes:
-
- 1) Time for curriculum and resource development.
- 2) Resources. Books, software, digital subscription services etc to support these programs, also available to the rest of the school.
-
- In the future, funding will also be requested for teacher training as the subjects grow in number and popularity. Support will also be sought from external agencies.

- The dubious promise of educational technologies- Historical patterns and future challenges - Jandric Cuban 2015.pdf
- In this article, Larry Cuban discusses his ideas about the topic of this Special Issue of E-learning and Digital Media ‚ÄòNetworked Realms and Hoped-For Futures: A trans-generational dialogue‚Äô with one of its co-editors, Petar Jandric ÃÅ. The conversation explores the historical relationships between education and information and communication technologies and draws lessons for pre- sent and future. The first part of the conversation explores methodological issues pertaining to historical thinking about schools and computers in the network society. It identifies a continued need to recognize historical patterns, including those in thought experiments, and shows that Rogers‚Äô theory of diffusion of innovations should be supplemented by more nuanced approaches to the historical relationships between schools and computers. The second part of the conver- sation presents an attempt to explain historical patterns using the ancient notion of magical thinking. It explores why teachers use computers in their private lives much more than in their professional lives, and ‚Äòschool anarchy‚Äô caused by student usage of personally owned devices in classrooms. It creates a baseline for comparison between desktop / laptop computers and various hand-held devices, and dismantles the quest for deschooling as another example of magical thinking. The third part of the conversation examines the ideological role of information and communication technologies in contemporary school reform and explores their potential for democracy. It analyses the contemporary transformations of traditional publishing formats such as books, journals and newspapers, and their reflections in the world of academia. It examines the changing role of teachers as public intellectuals, and the role of information and communication technologies in their public exposure. The last part of the conversation analyses the process of ‚Äòeducationalizing‚Äô various social and economic problems, and links it to contemporary technolo- gies. It revisits Larry Cuban‚Äôs predictions from Teachers and Machines: Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920 (1986), and reminds us that accurate predictions are rare, while inaccurate ones are not only common but often memorable. Finally, it examines why it is so hard to balance education with information and communication technologies.

- Introduction - revisit past insights into the relationships between education and technologies
- Introduction
- Petar Jandric ÃÅ (PJ): Larry, it is a great pleasure to have this opportunity for conversation! In this Special Issue, we invite authors to step back from the never-ending quest for new con- cepts and ideas and to revisit past insights into the relationships between education and technologies. Decades ago, in the article entitled ‚ÄòFour Stories: About National Goals for American Education‚Äô, you wrote:
-
-
- Historians invent the past
- Historians invent the past. I do not mean that historians invent facts, although they frequently discover new ones; I mean that historians ask questions of the past, analyse the available sources and evidence, and filter the data through their experiences, values, and expertise to create their own versions of what happened. Because historians are products of their times and differ one from the other, histories of the same event, era, or institution will vary. As vividly demonstrated in the classic film Rashomon, in which the story of an attack on medieval nobles is told from different points of view, history is woven out of multiple interpretations of what happened. (Cuban, 1990: 265)
-
- Rapid development of information and commu- nication technologies makes their past and present increasingly intertwined. Therefore, I would like to start this conversation by asking what happens to traditional historical thinking in the age of the network? Can we still apply traditional historical approaches to the questions concerning education and technologies? Using the metaphor from another of your early art- icles (Cuban, 1995), should we conduct our research like hedgehogs or like foxes?
-
- Larry Cuban (LC): I cannot recommend either the fox or hedgehog approach to research. Both seem to be essential but I do know for sure that I am a hedgehog. By that I mean I have persisted in investigating how teachers have taught during high visibility reform periods in the past and how policy, then and now, gets translated into classroom practice. Technological innovations, of course, mandated by policymakers or eagerly embraced by educators (or both) fit into my unrelenting focus on teachers and teaching, past and present.
-
- So I have looked at past efforts school reformers have made to introduce technological innovations and found patterns ‚Äì see Teachers and Machines (1986). Those cyclical patterns have accompanied new technologies for nearly a century:
-
- reform-minded policymakers surround the innovation with extravagant claims
- followed by academic studies showing limited or unimaginative classroom use of devices
- followed by disappointment and then blame heaped upon teachers
- rather than those who made the initial claims.
-
- Two current versions of that cycle I see unfolding right now with the spread in the US of tablets and 1:1 tablets and laptops. The cycle also appears in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in higher education.
-
- Knowing historically that these cycles have been present for over a century and how earlier generations of well-intentioned reformers faced similar situations as do current cheer- leaders for tablets and MOOCs could help contemporary decision-makers design policies and implementation campaigns that incorporate teachers early in the process of buying and deploying the newest high-tech device and software. In my judgement, then, describing and analysing the past, particularly the nexus between new technologies and schooling, is needed even more to inform policymakers, practitioners, and researchers.

- PJ: What do you think of attempts to inspire educational research by science fiction?
- PJ: What do you think of attempts to inspire educational research by science fiction? Could we interpret those imagined and/or hoped for futures as genuine thought experiments, or should they be taken much more lightly?
-
- LC: Futuristic scenarios of schooling predicting (or wishing for) what schooling will be like a half century or a full century from now have been around for decades. (Either inspired by science fiction or created out of one‚Äôs imagination, ones now put forth read like science fiction to me ‚Äì nearly all instruction for children and youth online and the disappearance of bricks and mortar schools with all schooling occurring in the home, workplace, and other settings.) A number of advocates for online learning in K-12 schools see the eventual replace- ment of formal schools by children and youth working at home and non-school sites includ- ing the workplace. Historically, I have seen so many of these fictional leaps into the future with a nearly inevitable lack of substantial movement toward such scenarios. So I remain highly sceptical of these scenarios. Nor do I take them seriously as thought experiments. I do take them seriously as hoped for futures. When such fictitious leaps do appear, they tell me more about the values and aspirations of the author(s) than predicting what will occur.

- Rogers‚Äô theory of diffusion of innovations
- PJ: Your works often refer to concepts from Everett Rogers‚Äô theory of diffusion of innovations (Jandric ÃÅ , 2012; Rogers, 1986, 1995) such as ‚Äòearly adopters‚Äô, ‚Äòlate adopters‚Äô and ‚Äòlaggards‚Äô (i.e. Cuban, 2003: 105). Up to fairly recently, it made a lot of sense to apply Rogers‚Äô theory to the relationships between computers and education: year by year, one could liter- ally see incremental increase in adoption of information and communication technologies in Western schools. Nowadays, however, when most citizens of the developed world are con- stantly connected, counting computers or users of certain software might seem a bit outdated. What is the relevance of Rogers‚Äô theory of diffusion of innovations for the contemporary relationship between education and information and communication technol- ogies? Could Rogers‚Äô theory be antiquated? Could it, perhaps, be complemented by more nuanced approaches? Where should we look for those new approaches?
-
- LC: You raise a nice point here. I have used Rogers‚Äô diffusion theory because it did fit the first three decades of the introduction of high-tech devices into schools. There are two reasons, however, that other theories should be tried out to explain the spread of both devices and software, of teacher use in classrooms, because, as you point out, devices and software are becoming ubiquitous in the developed world. First, Rogers‚Äô diffusion theory has certain biases built into it. For example, the theory favours those who adopt new technology over those who do not or are slow in embracing the innovation, i.e. ‚Äòlaggards‚Äô. The theory ignores the simple truth that in some situations with some innovations, teachers and other educators may have ample justification to say no to a new policy, a new device or software. Saying ‚Äòno‚Äô, however, is viewed as a negative within the theory. The second reason is that blame haunts the theory. For those who are slow to adopt or chose not to adopt, or when innovations suffocate for lack of resources, users such as teachers, more often than not, get blamed. That, too, is built into the theory.
-
- For those reasons, other ways of looking at how innovations spread should become part of the researcher‚Äôs repertoire. For example, theories that look more closely at the features of the innovation and the context in which the innovation is placed make a great deal of sense to me. The interaction between innovation characteristics and the conditions present in particular settings needs to be investigated without blaming who does the implementation or how it unfolds in particular settings. Also consider Hype Cycle developed by private sector consulting firm Gartner as another way of defusing bias and blame inherent in diffusion theory. The Hype Cycle tracks the historical path that technological innovations have followed. According to people‚Äôs expectations, it divides that path into the following five phases: technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, trough of disillusionment, slope of enlightenment and plateau of productivity (Gartner, 2014). In this way, the Hype Cycle offers another way to examine the context interacting with the innovation free of blame, but even this construct contains biases that need to be made explicit.

- Magical genie from the computer
- PJ: In a recent blog post, you quote Mike Trucano‚Äôs ‚Äòone of the 9 worst ed tech practices in the developing world: Dump hardware in schools, hope for magic to happen‚Äô (Cuban, 2014a), and expand it into a very interesting historical analysis
- Magical genie from the computer
- PJ: In a recent blog post, you quote Mike Trucano‚Äôs ‚Äòone of the 9 worst ed tech practices in the developing world: Dump hardware in schools, hope for magic to happen‚Äô (Cuban, 2014a), and expand it into a very interesting historical analysis. What is magical thinking in the context of schooling and computers? Where does it come from; will it ever end?
-
- LC: Magical thinking is a belief in scientifically unproven causal relationships between human actions and events. It may well be hard wired into our brains: after all, one can see it in action during illnesses we have, disappointment in careers, or even in troubled families. And it occurs in organizations undergoing stresses in dealing with serious problems. Thus, during times when schools have been heavily criticized for failing (which has been the case in the US since the mid-1950s), electronic technologies ‚Äì Skinner‚Äôs ‚Äòteaching machine‚Äô was popular in the 1950s ‚Äì have been drafted time and again to alter teaching and get students to learn more, faster and better. So magical thinking, in my opinion, seems to be connected to times when each of us, including school reformers, wish for a better, happier time. In a society enamoured with new technologies, it would seem to occur often.
-
-
- PJ: Oversold and Underused (Cuban, 2001) clearly shows that teachers use computers in their private lives much more than in their professional lives
- PJ: Oversold and Underused (Cuban, 2001) clearly shows that teachers use computers in their private lives much more than in their professional lives. Much of the reference to school usage of technology, however, is about its imposition, as it were, by authorities and interested groups. Is there any correlation between these facts? What about personal ownership of powerful technologies by the students and teachers themselves and what about their status as experienced (by some definitions) users of social media?
-
- LC: Yes, there is a correlation between mandated or imposed uses of new technologies and implementation problems showing up in classrooms, particularly if teachers‚Äô legitimate concerns and needs are ignored in the policy discussions about improved teaching and learning. That has happened often in past deployments of new technologies in the US. From the experiences of one-laptop-per-child in other countries, it may be the case as well.
-
- The gap in use of computers between school and home for teachers may be related to the above point and also linked to the lack of relevant software, on-site technical assistance, and lack of first-hand evidence that students will achieve more academically with electronic devices. The discrepancy in use between home and school has little to do with the teacher‚Äôs experience with devices or social media and far more to do with the historic role of teacher as gatekeeper to the classroom, a role that policymakers have generally overlooked or ignored for decades.
-
-
- PJ: What about the anarchy brought about by the students having their own devices, and the frequent response to this of banning the use of such personal devices in the classroom or school?
- PJ: What about the anarchy brought about by the students having their own devices, and the frequent response to this of banning the use of such personal devices in the classroom or school?
-
- LC: There have been examples of schools urging students to bring their own devices and having teachers work with a myriad of mobile devices. While some of these experiments may linger for a while, in an age where standardization in policy, procedure and equipment is the clear direction that the US and other nations have taken, such instances of bring-your-own- device will become footnotes to any history of technology use in schools.
-
- PJ: Your research clearly shows that large classroom desktop or laptop computers are Oversold and Underused, and predicts that with these technologies ‚Äòno fundamental change in teaching practices will occur‚Äô (Cuban, 2001: 196). During the past decade, however, computers have evolved into various hand-held devices that have become our constant companions. The desktop computer links us to the Internet, but the smartphone transforms us into truly networked, cyborg-like organisms which strongly resemble androids from James Cameron‚Äôs film Terminator. In Alone Together, Sherry Turkle calls that phenomenon ‚Äòthe new state of the self‚Äô (2012: 157), and identifies the ‚Äòlife mix‚Äô as ‚Äòthe mash-up of what you have on- and offline‚Äô (Turkle, 2012: 160). Inspired by your recent blog post about the effects of high-tech on people (Cuban, 2014b), could you try and create a baseline for comparison between those generations of technology? Do you think that this ‚Äònew state of the self‚Äô has the potential to challenge the ways that information and communication technologies are currently being used in education?
-
- LC: Yes, I do. The potential is there. Futuristic scenarios of virtual schools and the gradual elimination of bricks-and-mortar schools capture the potential that champions of accelerated online instruction push. Realizing those scenarios, however, will continue to disappoint advocates of establishing more virtual schools. Why?
-
- Advocates for virtual schooling largely ignore a historical fact. The larger political, social and economic role that public schools have performed (and continue to do so) has to be taken seriously since multiple goals for tax-supported public schools have been a reality for two centuries in US schools and I suspect for most other nations with publicly financed educational systems. Moreover, any gap between major changes in society, the economy and cultures, and what schools are doing has been translated time and again into school reforms to eliminate those gaps. In the US and most of Europe, tighter links between the economy and schools over the past quarter century, for example, have been forged in the belief that tougher standards, tests and accountability will improve schools and strengthen the economy by producing multi-skilled graduates entering the labour force.
-
- Or consider another example. The swift access and use of mobile devices in the US and developed world have not yet been matched by changes in how schools are organized, how teaching usually occurs and gains in student achievement ‚Äì expectations raised by the new technologies applied to schools. A large gap continues to exist between the daily whirl of information and communication devices outside the school and what teachers do with students inside their classrooms. In the US, a buying binge has occurred to stock classrooms with devices and new software to reduce the gap.
- But organizations, I have learned from both research and experience, have plans for those who seek to change routine policies and procedures inside those organizations, especially for a community institution with many aims (e.g., civic engagement, socializing the young into community values, reducing inequalities) that transcend acquiring information and swift communication. Most institutions such as schools, hospitals, the criminal justice system and the military try to maintain their stability amid constant calls for changing what they do. As organizations, these institutions have learned to incorporate changes into ongoing routines. Thus, stability and change exist in most of these institutions in uneasy tension. Academics call this tension: ‚Äòdynamic conservatism‚Äô (Scho Ãà n, 1971: 39). I see that dynamic conservatism at work in schools as they learn to accommodate to frequent and urgent calls for change in policies and daily practices. Too many cheerleaders for high-tech believe that hardware devices and software applications will revolutionize schooling practices. They, sadly, ignore or forget these lessons learned by earlier generations of reformers.
-
- PJ: You have spent more than half a century within schools. However, information and communication technologies have opened up vast spaces for less formal teaching and learn- ing. During the 1970s, a small band of researchers such as Everett Reimer (School is Dead, 1971), Paul Goodman (Compulsory Miseducation, 1973) and Ivan Illich (Deschooling Society, 1971) called for complete abandonment of the traditional concept of schooling through information and communication technologies. In order to replace traditional schools, Illich proposed creating large-scale, non-institutional educational infrastructure which consisted of a set of four interlocking educational networks: reference services to educational objects, skill exchanges, peer-matching and reference services to educators-at- large (Illich, 1971). After more than four decades, this vision is embodied in various initia- tives such as the Khan Academy (2014), and it is easy to agree with Hart‚Äôs conclusion that ‚Äòit is not too far-fetched to assert that Illich predicted the World Wide Web‚Äô (2001: 72). What do you think of the contemporary potential for deschooling?
-
- LC: Deschooling in 2014 comes wrapped in the mantle of total online or virtual schooling, home schooling and similar schemes that dispense with brick-and-mortar schools. Sure, access to the Internet and fire hydrant gushers of information does appeal to many champions of more high-tech in schools ‚Äì some of those champions, however, might wince at what Ivan Illich, Paul Goodman and Everett Reimer wrote in the full flush of school-haters in the 1960s and 1970s. What so many deschooling advocates overlooked then (and now) in their zeal to dismantle public schools, both good and bad ones, are the multiple functions that public schools serve in a democratic society. Most of the deschooling advocates were opposed to US schooling on ideological, not effectiveness, grounds. Schools taught conformity, squelched real learning, overlooked individual differences among children and youth, and were holding tanks for eventual dropouts.
-
- Today, eager promoters of high-tech in schools are less concerned about political and social ideology as that earlier generation was. Much of their eagerness for virtual schools is driven by the failure of public schools to be efficient and effective in producing graduates who can enter the labour market and be productive workers ‚Äì a different ideology, to be sure. Where producing graduates for the economy the primary goal of tax-supported public schools in the US, perhaps deschooling might have some traction. But that is not the case. Schools have custodial and socialization functions (e.g., becoming productive citizens, abiding by community norms, thinking critically, etc.) that are crucial to a democratic society. Deschooling advocates of the 1970s wanted to dispense with those functions completely. High-tech champions of online schooling and blended schools, too often ignore these functions in their lust for more, better, and faster information and communication in schools.
- PJ: Could we say, then, that the idea of deschooling is just another example of magical thinking?
- LC: Yes, it is a prime example of that wishful thinking.
-
- Public intellectuals in the age of the network
- PJ: In the first half of Tinkering toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform, you and David Tyack have analysed educational progress as ideology (1995). Following the main focus of our special issue ‚Äì the invitation ‚Äòto step back from the never-ending quest for new concepts and ideas and to revisit past insights into the relationships between education and technologies‚Äô (Jandric ÃÅ , Sinclair and Macleod, 2014) ‚Äì it would be interesting to expand your analysis of ideology to information and communication technologies. In Technology and Science as Ideology, Ju Ãà rgen Habermas claims that
-
- The progressive ‚Äòrationalisation‚Äô of society is linked to institutionalization of scientific and technological development. To the extent that technology and science permeate social institutions and thus transform them, old legitimations are destroyed. The secularisation and ‚Äòdisenchantment‚Äô of action-orienting worldviews, of cultural tradition as a whole, is the obverse of the growing ‚Äòrationality‚Äô of social action. (Habermas, 1970 (1968): 81)
-
- This claim is clearly reflected in many aspects of your work. Nowadays, for instance, ration- alization is often interpreted through introduction of business methods into schools and your book The Blackboard and the Bottom Line: Why Schools Can‚Äôt be Businesses (Cuban, 2005) provides prime arguments against destruction of old legitimations. However, Habermas‚Äô thinking is deeply embedded in the spirit of the industrial society powered by traditional mass media such as radio and television. Therefore, could you please reflect on the ideological role of information and communication technologies in contemporary school reform?
-
- LC: The ideology of progress embedded historically in school reform that David Tyack and I analyse in Tinkering Toward Utopia (1995) is still alive and well in 2014. It is called ICT (information and communications technology), online instruction and virtual schooling. Flush with hype, reformers promoted electronic technologies in the 1920s as ways of getting students to learn more, faster and better than they had, and for teachers to alter traditional ways of teaching. That continues today globally. While deep divisions among US school reformers exist, currently top political and business leaders see ICT, along with expanded parental choice of schools, national curriculum standards, testing and accountability for results, as the eight-cylinder engine for transforming schools into more efficient, effective institutions producing graduates who can enter the labour force and contribute to a growing economy. For example, the surge of interest in online instruction in elementary and second- ary public schools and the spread of virtual schools is one feature of the contemporary reform agenda mirroring this ideology of inevitable progress toward a more rational econ- omy, efficiently operated institutions and effective school performance.
-
- PJ: During the past decade or so, there has been a lot of talk about the potential of information and communication technologies for democracy (Jandric ÃÅ and Boras, 2012). In several books, including but not limited to Why Is It So Hard to Get Good Schools? (Cuban, 2003), Hugging the Middle ‚Äì How Teachers Teach in an Era of Testing and Accountability (Cuban, 2008) and Tinkering Toward Utopia: A Century of Public School Reform (Tyack and Cuban, 1995), you analysed the social role of education in a market-driven democracy. How do you link traditional relationships between education and democracy with information and communication technologies?
-
- LC: The short answer is ICT entered schools largely for economic and social reasons. Yes, there was also a political rationale such as increased civic participation in and out of schools, but it was clearly subordinate to the other reasons. The long answer is as follows.
-
- Beginning in the early 1980s with the introduction of the personal computer, reformers touted not only the use of computers in schools as the remedy for a declining economy and failing schools, but also a way of expanding child and youth participation in community affairs, building civic engagement and revitalizing the democratic spirit in the US. Keep in mind that using the word ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô can mean different things to different people: an individualistic-driven version, a communitarian one and a deliberative form. Such defin- itions matter and need to be made explicit. They went undefined in these years. Since those heady times, when scenarios of high-tech citizen participation became standard fare for those championing new technologies outside of schools, the belief that using computers and hand-held devices will strengthen policy deliberations and democratic practices in schools and at all levels of government (however defined) still remains a strong vision for ICT enthusiasts.
-
- The appeal of the Internet encouraging virtual communities and democratic participation has attracted academic researchers, political leaders, and educators. Lincoln Dahlberg (2001) and Benjamin Barber (1998) argue that these new technologies can nurture different forms of democracy but as far as I can see, beyond outlier examples, such arguments have yet to persuade educators to use ICT regularly in schools and classrooms to encourage more democratic practices in classroom lessons. Perhaps part of the reason for this is that in the past thirty-odd years, policy elites have stressed an economic rationale for schooling (i.e. prepare the next generations with job-anchored skills for an ever-changing workplace) thus superseding a political rationale, i.e. civic engagement. Thus, I have yet to see that the growth of new technologies, their ubiquity and use in schools have led to increased student participation either in schools or as high school graduates engaged in their communities, or even increased rates of voting over the past three decades.
-
- PJ: You are a prolific writer of academic books and articles, and a very active blogger. Since 2009, your website, Larry Cuban on School Reform and Classroom Practice (2014c), has been accessed nearly 800,000 times by readers scattered all around the world (nearly 40% are international viewers). More often than not, your texts have provoked vivid online discus- sions containing 30, 40 or even 50 responses. This level of public engagement demands a lot of your time and effort. In the current academic setting, however, it is definitely considered less ‚Äòimportant‚Äô than standard forms of academic writing. As Emeritus Professor, you do not have to worry about the status of your writings. However, the rest of us mortals must carefully choose our battles in order to survive in the academic markets. If you agree, I would like to ‚Äòattack‚Äô this problem on two separate levels. First, what is the future of traditional publishing formats (such as books, journals and newspapers) in the context of information and communication technologies? Second, how does it reflect to the world of the school/academia?
-
- LC: For someone who has only a 50% average in predictions ‚Äì see forecasts that I made in Teachers and Machines (Cuban, 1986) ‚Äì I have a mediocre record in looking around the corner to see the future interaction between ICT, academic advancement and traditional publishing formats, that is books, journals, etc. Consider that in the US there has been a steady drop in tenure-line positions in colleges and universities with a corresponding increase in short-term adjunct, non-tenure positions. For those academics in tenure-line posts seeking promotion, more and more peer-reviewed journals will be online and peer-reviewed e-books and similar electronic versions will spread. So I believe that getting published in traditional venues will continue to be the gold standard. In these tenure-line academic positions, I doubt very much whether being a blogger will help one get promoted, however. In the US, I do not know of any concerted effort in universities to include blogs as part of the portfolio sub- mitted for a tenure decision. Depending on the academic discipline, being first author on a team-produced article or writing a book will continue, in the short term, to be highly prized within colleges and universities. Once tenure is gained, however, for those academics who aspire to reach larger audiences (e.g. teachers, administrators, policymakers and parents) for their ideas and research, then blogging is clearly one venue that goes beyond those few thousand who read academic journals.
- I see writing for larger audiences as a form of teaching, not for academic advancement or influencing the discipline. Newspaper articles, blogging and writing for general audiences in large-circulation online and print magazines is a way of getting ideas into the school reform marketplace, offering different perspectives that readers may not have encountered elsewhere.
-
- PJ: Just a wild thought, Larry: have you ever considered turning your blog into a book? I‚Äôm sure that it would be fairly easy to cherry-pick the most interesting articles, together with some exciting discussions, and make a great and easy-to-read collection. Perhaps that would be a good way to integrate the technological and the traditional, the popular and the academic . . .
-
- LC: I have had that thought, Petar, but for now have dismissed it. I am currently working on a new project about the teaching of history in US schools a half-century ago and now. PJ: Sounds like a really interesting project, Larry ‚Äì I can‚Äôt wait to read about it! History is one of the subject areas which clearly show that teaching is much more than a job, and our duties reach far beyond achieving ‚Äòbenchmarks‚Äô of standardized curricula and testing. Whenever we enter our classrooms, our thoughts, opinions and attitudes become public ‚Äì in this sense, all teachers are public intellectuals. Up to a few decades ago, traditional mass media such as newspapers and books have allowed only so much space to publish our thoughts outside classrooms ‚Äì and entrance to this space has been carefully guarded by a whole structure of editors, reviewers and other gate-keepers. Nowadays, however, informa- tion and communication technologies are supporting wide spaces for public engagement without middlemen. Anyone can start a blog, and its success depends only on the author ‚Äì having skipped middlemen, we fall into a rabbit hole where millions of websites float and struggle for recognition. What are the main challenges pertaining to teachers‚Äô public engage- ment in the age of the network?
-
- LC: I have been very impressed by the last decade‚Äôs explosion of teacher and principal blogs, including ones from retired teachers and other practitioners. Many of my blog viewers are teachers and school-site administrators ‚Äì where they find the time to read and write I do not know ‚Äì and I learn a great deal from those who I read. I consider this flowering of teacher and administrator writing a decided plus for the profession and public debate over policy.
-
- Historical patterns and future challenges
- PJ: Your prologue to Tinkering Toward Utopia makes a very convincing historical argument that ‚Äòreforming the public schools has long been a favourite way of improving not just education but society‚Äô (Tyack and Cuban, 1995: 1). In your talk in Barcelona (Cuban, 2010), you named this process ‚Äòeducationalizing‚Äô of various social and economic problems. Similarly, information and communication technologies also seem to be perceived as a panacea for almost everything. Our factories are losing from competition? Let‚Äôs buy new computers. Our office productivity fails? Let‚Äôs buy new computers. Our students fail at standardized tests? Let‚Äôs buy new computers. For the purpose of this argument, I will name this process ‚Äòtechnologizing‚Äô of contemporary social problems and cautiously add that a Google search for this term returns only four sources. How would you analyse the relationships between ‚Äòeducationalizing‚Äô and ‚Äòtechnologizing‚Äô of our society?
-
- LC: David Labaree has used the term ‚Äòeducationalizing‚Äô to refer to the US policy elites‚Äô habit of using school reform to solve US social, economic and political problems (see Labaree, 2008). What ‚Äòeducationalizing‚Äô means is transferring societal structural problems to the institution of schooling so individual students and teachers then become first, an easy target to blame, and second, responsible for solving the problem. For example, national health problems of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol in the prior century got translated into school courses for youth about the physical and cognitive damages done by both drugs. Too many road accidents? Driver training and completing a safe driver‚Äôs course for high school graduation became a school-based solution to a national problem. And as you pointed out in your question, the harnessing of schools to an increasingly high-tech economy means that children and youth are engaged early and persistently in using electronic devices so that they can easily fit into a high-tech workplace. What you call ‚Äòtechnologizing‚Äô to me becomes just another instance of policy elites ‚Äòeducationalizing‚Äô a national economic problem into school reforms focusing on teacher and student use of devices, implying that such access and use of devices in schools across the country will somehow improve national economic growth and productivity.
-
- PJ: Three decades ago, you published Teachers and Machines: Classroom Use of Technology Since 1920. Only four years after the famous appearance of the computer on the cover of Time magazine in 1982, you dedicated a whole quarter of the book to ‚Äòthe promise of the computer‚Äô (Cuban, 1986: 72‚Äì103). Some of the presented conclusions are just as relevant today. For instance, it cannot be disputed that ‚Äòto question computer use in schools is to ask what schools are for, why teachers teach certain content, how they should teach, and how children learn‚Äô (Cuban, 1986: 98). At the time, however, it was impossible to predict the depth and extent of social change brought by information and communication technologies.
-
- Standing on the shoulders of previous research efforts, we can learn from fulfilled pre- dictions just as much as we can learn from failed promises. Based on the most successful predictions and the deepest historic failures, therefore, what can be learned from the first one hundred years of marriage between education and technologies? If you set out to rewrite Teachers and Machines, what would you do differently?
-
- LC: Thanks, Petar, for recalling that qupte from Teachers and Machines. It is the one I have used often. Please allow me to reproduce the blog post I wrote about this topic five years ago: A quarter-century ago, I described and analysed the history of machines deployed in classrooms (film, radio, instructional television and the newly arrived desktop computer) to help teachers teach more, faster and better. Then I did something foolish in the final chapter. I predicted future uses of computers in classrooms from my vantage point in 1986.
-
- Of course, I was not alone in making predictions. Seymour Papert dove into the same empty pool that I did a couple of years before my venture into crystal ball gazing: ‚ÄòThere won‚Äôt be schools in the future . . . I think the computer will blow up the school. That is, the school defined as something where there are classes, teachers running exams, people structured in groups by age, following a curriculum ‚Äìall of that‚Äô (Papert, 1984). Based upon my research in schools and experience as a teacher and superintendent, however, I was far more sceptical about the penetration and use of computers than Papert. Here is what I predicted in Teachers and Machines for computers in schools:
- I predict that...in elementary schools where favourable conditions exist, teacher use will increase but seldom exceed more than 10 percent of weekly instructional time [roughly 3 hours a week]. Pulling out students for a 30-to-45-minute period in a computer lab will, I suspect, gain increasing popularity in these schools . . . In secondary schools, the dominant pat- tern of use will be to schedule students into [labs] and one or more elective classes where a score of desk-top computers sit...In no event would I expect general student use of computers in secondary schools to exceed 5 percent of the weekly time set aside for instruction. I predict no great breakthrough in teacher use patterns at either level of schooling. (Cuban, 1986: 99)
-
- As events unfolded in the next quarter-century, my prediction flat-lined. Access to computers ‚Äì desktops, laptops, hand-held devices and interactive white boards ‚Äì soared. In writing Oversold and Underused: Computers in Classrooms (Cuban, 2001), I did find higher percentages of students and teachers using computers in preschools, secondary schools and universities that ruined my 1986 prediction. Since then, hundreds of thousands of students and tens of thousands of teachers across the country have received 1:1 laptops, tablets and white boards. In researching classrooms since 2001, again, I have found higher use by teachers and students in both elementary and secondary classrooms. More teachers ‚Äì my guess is over 30% across different districts ‚Äì use machines for instruction (I include the whole panoply of available high- tech devices) regularly, that is, at least once or more a week. Another 30 to 40% use computers occasionally, that is, at least once or more a month. The remainder of teachers ‚Äì still a sig- nificant minority ‚Äì hardly ever, if at all, use machines for instruction. This continues to puzzle researchers and policymakers since they know that nearly all teachers have high-tech devices at home. So my 1986 prediction on teacher and student use of computers for classroom instruc- tion was inaccurate and died a quiet death. Compassionate readers seldom remind me that I flopped in peeking into the future. The facts are clear that students and teachers use high-tech devices for instruction more than I had foreseen.
- One final confession. I stated clearly in Teachers and Machines and subsequent writings that the uses of new technologies for classroom instruction would seldom satisfy those advocates of more instructional use in schools, because teacher use would tend toward the traditional, blending both teacher- and student-centred approaches, and such approaches were seen as unimaginative. Not all teachers, by any means, but enough for the charge of uncreative teacher use to be commonly pointed out. Both of these predictions have turned out to be accurate . . . so far is a large block quote of Cuban (2010a).
-
- I confess to my errors in foreseeing the future for no other reason than to remind readers, both champions and sceptics of computers in schools, that accurate predictions are rare and inaccurate ones are not only common but often memorable. So if I re-wrote Teachers and Machines (Cuban, 1986) today, what predictions would I make? I would predict that well over 90% of US schools a quarter-century from now will be age-graded and brick-and- mortar, not virtual ones. There will be much more blending of online and face-to-face instruction in classrooms as students get older ‚Äì more of the latter in elementary schools and more of the former in secondary ones. Most teachers ‚Äì at least 75% ‚Äì will use some form of device regularly in parts of daily lessons because they have expanded their repertoire of teaching activities to achieve their goals for student learning. Those uses by teachers and students will be far more integrated into daily lessons, yet will still be criticized by that future generation of techno-enthusiasts as obsolete and unimaginative,
- PJ: At the very end of this exciting conversation, Larry, I would like to paraphrase one of my favourite titles (Cuban, 2003) on the long shelf of your books and ask a simple yet very important question: why is it so hard to balance education with information and commu- nication technologies?
- LC: The question assumes that ICT is a separate force apart from formal age-graded schooling. In one sense ICT has been separate because policy elites (business, civic and political leaders) as well as vendors have lobbied local, state and federal decision-makers to introduce computer devices into classrooms and schools. These lobbyists for ICT have argued unrelentingly for the past three decades that ICT will modernize schools, strengthen the economy, alter traditional teaching methods, and increase the academic performance of US students. And they have become increasingly successful as lobbyists for ICT. If any- thing, current spending on ICT has increased greatly in the last decade, suggesting an imbalance.
- The reasons for the increased access to ICT are straightforward: the historic pattern of a decentralized system of US schooling ‚Äì that is, nearly all 14,000 school boards are elected and fund their schools out of local monies. These local school boards have multiple goals to achieve in spending these monies and allocating staff, such as insuring that graduates are literate, can go to college or enter careers when they graduate, have embraced community values, get engaged in their communities and are independent thinkers. Such multiple goals and structures of local policymaking and funding guarantee conflicts among groups over how school dollars should be spent and the larger issue of civic leaders deciding how much money should schools get as compared to police, fire and other local agencies. The larger questions about what schools should teach, how teachers should teach and toward what ends schools should be aimed, may or may not be raised publicly, but answers to those questions vary among voters and policy elites.
- All of this decentralization in a rowdy democracy makes tax-supported schools politically vulnerable to shifts in school goals and practices. With the centralization of state and federal authority over schools since the mid-1960s, local lobbying still occurs, but the pattern of top- down mandates from state and federal authorities (e.g. No Child Left Behind and Common Core Standards) occurs far more often and reveals again how politically vulnerable local public schools are. After all, what I call ‚Äòpolitical vulnerability‚Äô non-educators and influential policymakers call ‚Äòdemocratic participation‚Äô by community leaders and their coalitions. And this is why ICT feels separate from education when, in actuality, it is part and parcel of what policy elites and voters believe teachers do daily in getting students to learn, with or without electronic devices.
-
- The short answer to your question, Petar, is that for tax-supported schools, democratic politics mean that those who want teachers and students to have more and better access and use of ICT in classrooms compete with other interest groups that seek an upgraded science curriculum, less (or more) standardized testing, more (or fewer) charter schools, and judging teacher effectiveness on the basis of student test scores. That is why ‚Äòit is so hard to balance education with information and communication technologies‚Äô.

- Introduction
- Everyone knows the future is important. That is why we spend many millions of dollars on education, defence, power stations, hospitals and so on. Every large organisation has discovered that it has to plan ahead and to make forecasts about future conditions. Otherwise too many things can go wrong: the stock of essential parts runs out and production stops; market conditions change and the product or service is no longer saleable; the competition develops a better product; the enemy's contingency plans were better. Futures studies as a field of enquiry has emerged in response to demands of this kind.
- With all this activity one might have expected that futures would be seen to be a natural and inevitable part of education. After all, much of our teaching and learning focuses upon the future. But, until recently, this has not been the case.
- Futures in education is a direct response to change and the recognition that there are problems, dangers and choices ahead which have few, if any, historical precedents. This paper looks at the substance of futures study, the origins of futures work in education, at the rationales which have been put forward and at patterns of innovation and implementation.

- Substance of futures study
- Much discussion about futures begs the question of what is being studied. This raises genuine concern since in crude empirical terms it has been suggested that 'the future' does not exist. How, therefore, may one study it? When this line of argument is raised at least three comments are relevant. First that empiricist approaches tend to focus on the tangible and the measurable. Second, that the argument overlooks the primacy of values and meanings (etc) which are in no way diminished by the non-material status. Third, that there is more than one meaning to the word 'future'. In one restricted sense it does indeed stand for that which is beyond, out of reach, yet to come. But rather than stressing notions of separateness, distance, and the problematic aspects of futures, other uses stress the way that futures concerns permeate the present.
- To put it briefly, there are at least two key 'strands' to futures study. One is the strand which examines perceptions of futures. The other attempts to come to grips with some processes of continuity and change. Futures study draws on a wide range of human capacities and deploys a number of specific concepts and methodologies in pursuit of these two types of understanding. The results of this activity lead into a wide range of issues, themes and applications including futures in education.¬†Ôøº

- Futures study as a forward looking matrix
- It is crucial for the latter that these relationships are recognised and understood. A field which sometimes generates questions about its subject matter and methods must be able to show that it is properly-grounded, comprehensible and useful. It's also important that those who are engaged in teaching futures actually utilise futures concepts and tools. Two common mistakes in futures teaching concern the failure to utilise these concepts and a tendency to over-emphasise extrapolation (ie 'the future of ....' approach).
- A sample of futures concepts which I regularly use is discussed elsewhere.¬†1¬†There is a reciprocal relationship between such concepts and human capacities. One could say that the former 'enable' the latter, and that the latter 'drive' the former. The combination of concepts and capacities help to structure a forward-looking perceptual field. These perceptions both shape the character of futures study and provide part of its subject matter. The methodologies arise from all of the above and represent the active outworking of futures concerns at the social, institutional and group levels.
- Futures methodologies focus on the present and possible future states of processes. Frequently the concern is with change: social, economic, technical, environmental and, less frequently, value change. However, continuities (of language, tradition, meaning) are equally important and with increasing interest in alternatives to conventional assumptions about economic growth, the 'steady-state' side of the equation is receiving more attention.
- The concern with processes lends futures study and research an empirical dimension which many of its critics have not noticed. In order to say anything of value about the possible future states of dynamic systems it is necessary to know a great deal about the past and present. This is partly why futures has sometimes been characterised as a 'summarising discipline'. It necessarily draws on a very wide range of sources. Finally, the whole structure as I have described it gives rise to a number of characteristic issues, themes and applications.
- There are two major implications for futures in education. First, the futures field is a serious field of enquiry which can stand up to the most exacting and rigorous enquiry. It therefore provides a sound basis for educational work. Second, the value of the field to education solely in terms of its symbolic resources is considerable. The concepts and methods involved are capable of much wider application and use than they have yet received.
- Origins of futures in education
- Futures per se are an ancient concern. The earliest makers of stone tools carried a clear image in their minds of the purpose which the tools would fulfill and this guided their work. The earliest dwellings and villages were constructed according to plans which reflected present and future communal needs. Agriculture only became practicable when the changes of the seasons could be understood and predicted with assurance. The person who plants seeds must feel that it is likely he or she will reap a subsequent crop. Otherwise it is not worth the effort and, moreover, the family could starve.
- In other words, the future is organically bound up with everyday life. Or, to put it differently, we can say that¬†futures are constitutive of the present. Take away the futures dimension and what remains is not worth living in because you would have also removed the 'space' needed for plans, purposes, goals, meanings, intentions and so on. We all require a future (or futures) in order to live. I often ask teachers to imagine they are taking a foreign trip. I ask them to consider the way they go about it. They think about climate, clothing, transport schedules, money, insurance, maps and so on. Bearing this in mind we then think about school curricula and the way these embody purposes and meanings which relate to the future. Usually such forward-looking concerns take the form of aims, objectives, goals and, more distantly, some notion of how present activities contribute to the development and evolution of society. All, of course, are true futures concerns. That's why I often remark that¬†schools are already in the futures business, though few of them realise it yet.
- The first school courses with an explicit futures label were taught in the USA and Canada in the mid-1960s. They drew upon the wider field of futures research which had itself developed in the context of the cold war and its military scenarios. That, in turn, was rooted in the strategic need to move military personnel and materials in a co-ordinated way, and in conditions of great uncertainty, during the great wars. The techniques of planning, forecasting, war-gaming and scenario analysis were seen to have value well beyond military applications. With a number of other techniques they were quickly assimilated into government, business and industry.
- Even today, when futures study and research is a global concern, the USA remains the heartland of futures work. It has more forecasters, consultants, futures researchers, marketing analysts and science fiction writers per head than any other country. So when the first school course was taught there in 1966 it was because people had seen dramatic changes and knew that the future could no longer simply be assumed. Whereas once it extended unproblematically ahead, now there were more and more possibilities, some of them not particularly pleasant.
- A number of pilot projects were funded by the then Office of Education and these led to the establishment of centers where futures were studied and taught. The University of Houston at Clear Lake City offered one of the most comprehensive masters programs in futures. The World Future Society entered the picture and by the early 1970s its education section had a professional membership of several thousand. Conferences, publications and seminars followed all over the continental USA and in other countries. By this time a number of international networks and organisations had sprung up. Perhaps the most productive and durable of these is the World Futures Studies Federation.
- In virtually every Western country, groups of innovators based in schools, colleges and universities began to learn from each other and to perceive that they were part of a wider shift. A shift from immersion in a taken-for-granted past and present to a conscious evaluation of possible, probable and preferable futures. While the futures education movement in the USA seemed to falter under increasingly unfavourable political and economic conditions, others took up the work which had been started there and improved upon it. Today on a global scale there are thousands of teachers, lecturers and researchers with an interest in futures in education. With over twenty years' work completed it is clear that futures in this context may sometimes appear new but the principles involved are certainly not untested.
- Elements of a rationale for futures in education
- Rationales take various forms in various places. But among the most commonly cited suggestions are the following.
- 1.	Rapid change means that many past assumptions, meanings and purposes are no longer valid and self-evident. In this context, past knowledge, and earlier modes and methods of representing knowledge do not command automatic support. Past experience becomes less and less reliable.
- 2.	Actions and decisions have consequences. In a world which is physically and socially interconnected many of the latter are displaced in space and time (for example, acid rain, ozone depletion and terrorism). Futures thinking therefore becomes a strategic imperative.
- 3.	'Preaction' or careful forward thinking is preferable to 'crisis management'. It represents a saving of the energy which would otherwise be expended clearing up the mess.
- 4.	Images of futures condition the present. Both positive and negative images feed back into the present and affect what people consider to be worth doing. These images are being continuously negotiated at all levels of society, though often in implicit. hidden, ways (for example, through advertising). Many images are ambiguous in that it is the human response to the image which is crucial, not the simple fact of the image itself.
- 5.	Futures are not abstractions. Since they cannot be measured they have been illegitimately dismissed by empiricist frameworks of enquiry. But the future (as a category) is 'a principle of present action'. Without it we could not act at all. The human capacity to articulate plans, purposes, goals, intentions and meanings relies upon an open and undetermined future.
- 6.	The taken-for-granted present does not indicate a specific period of time because the mental present has no firm boundaries. Aspects of past and future are enfolded within the present and schools can be much more explicit about what this involves for teaching and learning.
- 7.	Education is a major institution which has strong roots in the past. Yet it cannot simply try to reproduce the past. It requires credible futures alternatives in order to make sense of the present and to establish appropriate strategies and directions.
- 8.	It is not possible to change the past, though the past is continuously re-interpreted (because we never stand at the end of history). Our relation to the future is different. We all exert our will and our intentionality upon it, and attempt to shape it according to our perceptions and needs. This is a much more active stance than we can adopt in relation to the past.
- 9.	The implicit model of personhood we apply to schooling affects the way we view futures. If students are viewed as interpreters of culture and makers of meaning (agents) there is a direct connection between futures and the curriculum. This connection is obscured in more instrumental views.
- 10.	Pupils are already alert to futures. Hence they do not need to be coerced into considering it further. They are naturally interested in the unfolding of their own lives. Many have fears about unemployment, pollution and nuclear war. It is important to help pupils channel their energies which support these fears into strategies which address the source of the fear.
- Futures in education in the UK
- In Britain a number of individuals and individual institutions have developed their own initiatives locally and there have been a few attempts to integrate these. The World Future Society has not developed a large enough membership in Britain to sustain meetings of the kind common in the USA. (The WFSF is much smaller but it is a true global network that holds meetings all over the world.) The pattern of innovation is therefore a decentralised one, with people making changes and taking initiatives wherever they happen to be.
- For example, a group of teachers at Pocklington school in Yorkshire developed a sixth-form general studies course entitled¬†Possible Futures¬†focusing on such issues as the nature of humanity, urban areas and knowledge versus wisdom. The design faculty of the Open University offered a course entitled¬†Man-Made Futures¬†for several years. The course materials were among the best produced anywhere. A number of other universities have offered courses with titles such as¬†Alternative Futures¬†as part of a humanities degree, but Oxbridge appears not to have noticed. Two projects can be mentioned. One is Simon Nicholson's¬†Children in Futures¬†project which aimed to give children access to media in order to explore their own interests and their own images of futures. Another is the ‚Äòimplications of critical futures study for the theory and practice of curriculum‚Äô which surveyed futures work world-wide, developed a systematic basis for curriculum innovation and rendered some futures tools and techniques into a form teachers can use.¬†2
- Conferences and workshops have been few and far between. A potentially significant two-day invitation workshop co-sponsored by the UK Futures Network and the University of London Institute of Education was held in February 1985 but was not followed up. Conferences on futures-related themes are common but none to my knowledge has explored the centrality of futures as a coherent intellectual, academic or practical focus within education. The nearest to this are the occasional meetings sponsored from outside the formal system. For example, the¬†Education for Life¬†conferences organised by the Mediating Network in Brighton in 1986 and 1987. Also the¬†Education for the Twenty-First Century¬†meeting held at the Findhorn Foundation, Forres, Scotland in 1986. Both of the latter were true futures gatherings, though they were grounded in futures movements rather than in the wider field (embracing futures research, futures study and the futures movements).
- Content and process in futures education
- During a survey of curriculum units, modules and materials I found a wide variety of work from around the world. Some of it was of a very high quality indeed, but several things stood out clearly.
- 1.	Very few curriculum offerings were clearly and explicitly grounded in a specific theoretical framework.
- 2.	There was wide variability between the foci chosen for study. Considerable attention was paid to futures methodologies and to specific issues. But theories, creativity and real-world connections were relatively rare.
- 3.	Almost none of the materials studied were broad or balanced (in the sense of covering the range of the field in a coherent way).
- 4.	There was very little evidence of sustained treatment of specific foci over a period of time using a succession of approaches and methods.
- 5.	No agreed framework of analysis of evaluation could be found.
- 6.	No comprehensive view of the content and process of futures in education was then available (other than in books referring specifically to the USA).
- It was clear that the decentralised pattern of innovation I had noticed in Britain also applied on a wider scale. People tended to create innovations in a vacuum, as it were, with very little knowledge of work carried out elsewhere. Hence, in an attempt to provide some sort of standard outline of the range of existing work, I developed the notion of a 'model futures curriculum'.
- Given the variety of approaches noted - some leaning heavily toward methodology, others toward local issues, still others toward child participation and creativity - it was hard to generalise about curriculum process. However, on the whole, teachers tended to utilise pupil-centred approaches rather than more formal methods and to engage students in matters of concern to them. The few evaluations available strongly suggest that students find futures studies enjoyable and, in some sense, 'liberating' or 'empowering'. This was certainly the case at Lancaster (UK) with teachers who have taken the MA module¬†Futures Study and Curriculum Design.¬†3
- At the time of writing (1988) an adequate account of classroom practice had yet to be written. There are still far too few researchers and scholars working in this field. Yet what is known suggests that futures study injects a new sense of purpose into obsolescent curricula. The¬†latent¬†demand for this work therefore appears to be considerable. How to activate that latency remains a key question and challenge.
- Implementation
- There are basically three approaches to implementation.
- 1.	The introduction of discrete futures units or modules into an existing curriculum program.
- 2.	The introduction of futures as a dimension of existing subjects and curriculum foci.
- 3.	The reconceptualisation of a schools' modus operandi according to futures concepts and methods.
- Approach three is the most ambitious and it has not been tried in Britain. However, overseas examples such as the Montclair Futures School in New Jersey and initiatives by the Barcelona school system, show that it is a viable option where resources, staffing and support are available. It does presuppose that adequate training, materials and leadership are present locally, and this is clearly not often the case.
- Approach two requires that a 'prime mover', such as a head teacher, take on the task of a school-wide shift in content and process. In current circumstances this is difficult and it has not been widely attempted. Nevertheless, given the right environment and support, it does represent a way forward. If teachers are given the time to familiarise themselves with futures concepts and approaches, most tend to change what they do in small but significant ways. Since Futures Studies is a cross-circular dimension it can be approached in this way.
- The first approach is the commonest since it means that highly-motivated individuals can innovate in their own classrooms without disturbing established procedures elsewhere. It is becoming increasingly common for general studies, social and life skills, careers, domestic science, languages, drama and design to include an explicit futures component and many new courses have recently been designed along these lines.
- It is possible to combine elements of the above. But for the time being the likelihood is that option three will continue to be the most popular approach to implementation.
- Conclusion
- Very occasionally a new insight or approach will illuminate the taken-for-granted world in a new way. This was true of the theory of evolution. It was true of quantum theory and the view back of the planet Earth from space. In a more modest way futures in education represent another paradigmatic shift of perception. The weaknesses of some early approaches have now been corrected and a systematic basis for futures work is now available. This means that schools can take up the available tools and understandings and integrate them into every aspect of their work.
- Futures is not simply another subject or curriculum focus entering into competition in an already overcrowded curriculum. It is a true metaperspective grounded in a coherent body of theory and practice. A thumbnail definition of futures is that it is¬†the forward-looking equivalent of history. If the latter enables us to study where, in some collective sense, we have come from, the former allows us to consider where we may wish to go. The two are closely linked and accounts of 'good' history teaching are often equally applicable to futures. But at the end of the twentieth century a new shift is needed. It is a shift of consciousness and perception which understands that the past is indeed past. It has much to teach us, yet it cannot be altered. Human will, intentionality and responsibility face in another direction - toward the emerging future. As Ziegler has noted, the future is less a realm of knowledge than of action.¬†4
- At this particular point in time it is the future which should command our attention - not least of all because of the many unresolved difficulties and problems associated with our transition from the industrial era. Far from being a distant abstraction, the study of futures has now become indispensable within education, as elsewhere. To draw fully on this field of enquiry is to open up new options for innovation and development. It is to bring into schools the means to participate fully in the transition process and thereby fulfill their obligations both to individuals and to society at large.
- A cynical view asks ‚Äòwhat has posterity done for me?‚Äô Jonathon Schell is probably correct with his devastating assertion that ‚Äòformerly the futures was given to us - now it must be achieved.‚Äô 5 But my preference is for Kenneth Boulding's insightful observation that ‚Äòthe future is the way I repay my debt to the past.‚Äô It captures what is, perhaps, the underlying theme of much futures work: our inextricable involvement in a universal process embracing past, present and future.

- 5. A FUTURES PERSPECTIVE
- Lessons from the school room
- In this chapter I firstly set out some of the problems faced by practising teachers in relation to the academic field of futures studies and then clarify the educational rationale for developing a ‚Äòfutures perspective‚Äô in the school curriculum. Whilst schools have a crucial role to play in helping young people think about the future what is actually possible and appropriate is dependent on children‚Äôs ages. I outline some of what is currently known about children and young people‚Äôs perceptions of the future and then give an example of how teachers and students who intend to be teachers can be introduced to these concerns. Finally I indicate some of the areas of futures education that require further research.
- PROLOGUE
- Teachers as professionals
- All good futurists would probably like other professionals to be enthused about their field. This is because it seems self-evident to us that the insights from futures studies could be of benefit to most other academic fields. Wendell Bell (1997, p. xxi) thus argues that specialists in other disciplines would benefit from futurising their thinking and I would agree with this. Why, therefore, do I find social commentators generally and teachers in particular so uninformed about futures studies? I suspect Jim Dator (1998, p. 298) had the answer when he addressed readers of the American Behavioural Scientist:
- ... the chances are very good that ... you have never taken a course in futures studies; never met a person who teaches it at the university level; teach or study on a campus where futures studies is not offered; and probably associate futures studies (if the term means anything to you at all) either with astrology and charlatans or with Alvin Toffler, John Naisbitt, or Faith Popcorn ... Your most fundamental images of the future are almost certainly shaped primarily by films and videos you have seen.
- This would certainly be true for most school teachers but it would also be reinforced by other forces relating to the professional context in which they work. Most teachers consider themselves to be first and foremost educators, that is, they feel they have an obligation to educate rather than proselytise. They thus feel it would be wrong to add things to the curriculum simply because other professionals feel they should and, anyway, the content of the curriculum may not be up for negotiation if the education system is a highly centralised one. Secondly, many teachers in industrialised countries have been suffering from ‚Äòcurriculum fatigue‚Äô in particular as a result of neoliberal policies which have lead to increasingly utilitarian and market driven forms of education. Thirdly, teachers may unwittingly resist innovative change because schools are but one of the many sites of cultural reproduction which reflect prevailing hegemonic forces. They, as well as their pupils, are often unable to think ‚Äòoutside the box‚Äô whether socially or culturally, as Apple (1993) and Giroux (1992) have argued at length, or ecologically, as writers such as Orr (1994) and Bowers (1997) have argued. Western forms of education, whether as practised at home or exported, thus tend to reflect white, male, neoliberal views of the world (Apple, 2001)‚Äîand of the future (MilojevicÃÅ, 2002).
- Children and Youth
- If we believe that adults can benefit from the insights of futures studies in their personal lives, their work and their communities, then what they might or might not have learnt about futures in their youth and childhood needs to be of vital interest too. I use the term futures education, as against futures studies, to distinguish what may or may not go on in schools and formal education up to the age of 18. Whilst culture, ethnicity, gender and class will affect young people‚Äôs views of the future (as it also does for adults), what in particular affects them is the process of childhood socialisation and development.
- How children conceptualise the future varies with age. In early childhood we are dealing with quite different notions of the future to those held by older children (Page, 2000). As they enter the middle years of schooling (7‚Äì14), children‚Äôs views begin to take on some aspects of adult understanding (Hicks & Holden, 1995) and these mature with age. Youth futures (15‚Äì25) have also been noted as a specific category differing in crucial ways from adult views (Gidley & Inayatullah, 2002). A range of important changes are thus taking place in youth and childhood which makes futures education a distinctly different enterprise to that of futures studies. How adults conceptualise the future is largely a result of what did, or did not, happen to them during this crucial formative period.
- The Problem with Futures Studies
- The problem with futures studies for teachers is that most of them will never have heard of it for the reasons given by Dator above. If they do come across the field, it appears to be an academic and research-based activity carried on in universities. This puts most teachers off because universities seem remote from their daily life in classrooms. The nature of futures studies is thus likely to be misunderstood and, even if understood, not seen as immediately useful to teachers in schools. There is nowhere I can point to at the moment in the UK as an example of good practice in futures education. Whilst the English Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has a Futures Programme (www.qca.org.uk/11232.html), on closer inspection this turns out to be primarily about the future of the curriculum and contains little that specifically helps teachers think more critically and creatively about a range of alternative futures, whether for society or education.
- Many other issue-orientated academic fields have given rise to lively and innovative educational fields. Examples include global education, development education, environmental education, peace education, intercultural education. Whilst each maintains its own distinct identity, many see these fields as potential allies with overlapping interests. When educators refer by name to these issue- based educations what is generally missing, however, is any reference to futures studies or futures education. In other words, we have as yet to gain widespread credibility with natural educational allies. One of the few exceptions is Pike and Selby‚Äôs (1999) model of global education which argues that the spatial and temporal dimensions of the curriculum are of equal importance.
- FUTURES EDUCATION
- Educational Rationale
- Whilst ‚Äòfutures education‚Äô or ‚Äòfutures in education‚Äô are useful shorthand terms to designate the application of futures ideas to formal schooling and teacher training, it is important to recall that this is not generally part of the everyday vocabulary of teachers. They are more likely to talk about ‚Äòpreparing children for the future‚Äô and, if urged to be more specific about the future in their teaching, would probably demand a clear educational rationale for this. This is an appropriate request for an educator to make and one that can easily be answered in the professional language of teachers as shown below in Table 1.
- Table 1. Rationale for a futures dimension in the curriculum
- Pupil motivation
- Pupil expectation about the future can affect behaviour in the present, e.g., that something is, or is not, worth working for. Clear images of desired personal goals can help stimulate motivation and achievement.
- Anticipating change
- Anticipatory skills and flexibility of mind are important in times of rapid change. Such skills enable pupils to deal more effectively with uncertainty and to initiate, rather than merely respond to, change.
- Critical thinking
- In weighing up information, considering trends and imagining alternatives, pupils will need to exercise reflective and critical thinking. This is often triggered by realising the contradictions between how the world is now and how one would like it to be.
- Clarifying values
- All images of the future are underpinned by differing value assumptions about human nature and society. In a democratic society pupils need to be able to begin to identify such value judgements before they can themselves make appropriate choices between alternatives.
- Decision making
- Becoming more aware of trends and events which are likely to influence one‚Äôs future and investigating the possible consequences of one‚Äôs actions on others in the future, leads to more thoughtful decision making in the present.
- Creative imagination
- One faculty that can contribute to, and which is particularly enhanced by, designing alternative futures is that of the creative imagination. Both this and critical thinking are needed to envision a range of preferable futures from the personal to the global.
- A better world
- It is important in a democratic society that pupils develop their sense of vision, particularly in relation to more just and sustainable futures. Such forward looking thinking is an essential ingredient in both the preserving and improving of society. Responsible citizenship
- Critical participation in democratic life leads to the development of political skills and thus more active and responsible citizenship. Future generations are then more likely to benefit, rather than lose, from decisions made today.
- Aims of Futures Education
- In exploring the elements of such a rationale with teachers it then becomes possible to talk about the need for a ‚Äòfutures dimension‚Äô within the curriculum and the need for pupils to develop a ‚Äòfutures perspective‚Äô, i.e., the ability to think more critically and creatively about the future. The specific aims of futures education can be formulated as helping teachers and pupils to:
- ‚Äì develop a more future-orientated perspective both on their own lives and events in the wider world;
- ‚Äì identify and envision alternative futures which are just and sustainable;
- ‚Äì exercise critical thinking skills and the creative imagination more
- effectively;
- ‚Äì participate in more thoughtful and informed decision making in the
- present; and
- ‚Äì engage in active and responsible citizenship, both in the local, national
- and global community, and on behalf of present and future generations
- Aims such as these are of interest to a wide range of educators concerned with subjects such as English, maths, science, technology, geography, history, modern languages, business studies and religious education. They are also of particular relevance to equal opportunities, multicultural education, and cross-curricular themes such as education for sustainability, citizenship, and personal and social education.
- At the same time, discussion with teachers and teacher educators in various countries reveals that the future is largely a missing dimension within education. Gough‚Äôs (1990) investigation into the portrayal of futures in educational discourse is invaluable here. After examining a range of educational documents he identified three common types of reference to the future‚Äîtacit, token and taken‚Äìfor‚Äìgranted. Tacit futures are all those which are assumed and never brought out into the open. They remain hidden and unexplicated but nevertheless present. Thus the future may not even be mentioned in an educational document but assumptions about it are still tacitly present. Token futures often involve clich√©s and stereotypes presented in a rhetorical fashion. Gough (1990, p. 303) notes, ‚ÄúWhen one finds ‚Äòthe future‚Äô (or a futures-oriented inference) in the title of an educational document it usually means much less than might be expected‚Äù. Taken‚Äìfor‚Äìgranted futures occur whenever a particular future, or range of futures, is described as if there were no alternatives. Discussion of the future framed solely in terms of science and technology or work and leisure would be in this category.
- Insights from Futures Studies
- It is interesting to reflect on which insights and concepts from futures studies have been taken up by teachers and used in their work and also how they have been developed for use with children. Whilst the teaching materials available to schools are still relatively limited, it is nevertheless still possible to give some idea of the concepts that have been taken up. The following examples are fairly representative of responses over the last 25 years in Western education.
- Amongst the concepts used in a seminal booklet from the US National Council for Social Studies (Fitch & Svengalis, 1979) are: possible, probable and preferable futures; utopian and dystopian writing; assumptions about time; scenarios; trend analysis; forecasting; cross-impact matrices; and futures wheels. Riley‚Äôs (1989) resource book for teachers includes: possible, probable and preferable futures; trend extrapolation; futures wheels; Delphi technique; cross-impact matrices; scenarios; values and the future; imaging; and timelines. Pike and Selby‚Äôs (1999) resource book on global education refers to: possible, probable and preferable futures; futures wheels; intergenerational justice; and sustainability. A resource book on citizenship education (Hicks, 2001) contains: images of the future; futures wheels; probable and preferable futures; rights of future generations; scenarios; and sustainable futures. Contributors to Gidley and Inayatullah‚Äôs (2002) book on youth futures further confirm that a wide range of futures tools are being used with young people as does Slaughter and Bussey‚Äôs Futures Thinking for Social Foresight (2006).
- YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE FUTURE
- Understanding how children and young people develop their ideas about the future is crucial since it is from this formative period that adult perceptions emerge. The importance of futures education in schools lies in its capacity to challenge often unconscious processes. The literature on children and young people‚Äôs views of the future has been growing slowly since the mid-90s and a flavour of this will be given under the headings primary, secondary and youth. (NB. Since ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô encompasses 11‚Äì18 and ‚Äòyouth‚Äô 15‚Äì25, there is an overlap between these two categories.) As you will notice the research still has a very Western bias so one should be cautious about generalising from this.
- Primary Level
- It is a common assumption amongst many teachers that younger pupils have little conception of issues in the wider world. However, Fountain (1990) points out that nursery and infant children (age 4‚Äì7) regularly: call each other names (prejudice); arbitrarily exclude others from their play (discrimination); argue over materials (resource distribution); protest that rules are not fair (human rights); quarrel and fight (peace and conflict); waste consumable materials (environmental awareness); find out that more can be accomplished by working together (interdependence). Issues that might initially be considered national or global are thus present in many classrooms and need to be recognised and worked with.
- One of the few educators to explore how young children conceptualise the future is Australian early years specialist Jane Page (2000), who notes that futures educators generally ignore this age group. Her work with 4 and 5 year olds, however, shows that futures concepts are beginning to be developed at this age. The children she studied have a fundamentally different attitude towards the future, time and change than older children. Time is viewed purely in terms of the child‚Äôs own activities, i.e., in four sleeps rather than four days time. They cannot understand that time exists independent of themselves, but there is a growing sense of progression beginning with notions of ‚Äòbefore‚Äô and ‚Äòafter‚Äô and moving on to ‚Äòyesterday‚Äô and ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äô.
- The ‚Äòfuture‚Äô means being older or things changing. There is a growing awareness of societal issues, for example the environment, war, music, places and events in the news. Thinking about the future at this age involves imaginative fantasy, past and future often get mixed up (they are both the ‚Äònot now‚Äô), and there is a great sense of control and freedom over the future in such play. Whilst this may seem idiosyncratic and unrealistic from an adult point of view, this is a vital developmental stage. Young children are developing positive feelings about their place in the future and their role in its creation and are more positive than older children about the future.
- Whilst different levels of ability are found in conceptualising the future at 7‚Äì8, this is when initial manifestations of an ‚Äòadult‚Äô understanding of time begin to appear. Research by Hicks and Holden (1995) in England shows the emergence of an ability to think ahead and the realisation that the future may be something to work towards as well as something to be concerned about. Reality and fantasy may still sit side by side and children sometimes fear that their own area may be subject to violence and wars seen in other places on TV. There is a growing awareness of social and environmental issues and children are generally optimistic that the future will be better both for themselves and others. However, some think problems such as pollution and poverty may get worse. Boys often fear global disasters, for example the world exploding or aliens landing.
- Secondary Level
- Understandably, young people‚Äôs concerns for the future tend to reflect current national and global events although these may change over time. In the 90s Hicks and Holden (1995) found that in relation to their personal futures English adolescents were concerned about getting a good job, having a good life, issues of health, good relationships and doing well at school. In relation to the futures of their local community they identified crime and violence, jobs and employment, the range of amenities, and environmental threats as their main concerns. In terms of the global future, they were worried about issues of war and peace, environmental damage, poverty and hunger, and relationships between countries. Pessimism increased with age and most felt that they had not learnt enough about these issues at school.
- Oscarsson‚Äôs (1996) work with Swedish teenagers showed similar findings. A majority of pupils had a positive view of their own future, although many reported what he called ‚Äòuncertain optimism‚Äô in relation to work. Unemployment was seen as the main threat to their personal futures and, to a lesser extent, environmental problems. They had a less optimistic vision of Sweden‚Äôs future, however, often expressing concern about economic conditions. Nearly two-thirds had a pessimistic view of the global future, particularly in relation to environmental issues and to a lesser extent warfare. Their views of the global future were more pessimistic than those of personal or Swedish futures. Brunstad‚Äôs (2002) research in Norway and Rubin‚Äôs (2000) in Finland echo some of these ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô themes. Rubin also examines in some depth the relationship between young people‚Äôs concerns and the wider socio-cultural context.
- Hutchinson‚Äôs (1996) work with Australian teenagers focused in particular on the nature of their probable and preferable futures. Their probable futures fell into six broad categories: i) an uncompassionate world (depersonalised and uncaring); ii) a physically violent world (with a high likelihood of war); iii) a divided world (between ‚Äòhaves‚Äô and ‚Äòhave-nots‚Äô); iv) a mechanised world (of often violent technological change); v) an environmentally unsustainable world (with continued degradation of the biosphere); and vi) a politically corrupt and deceitful world (where voting is a waste of time). Their preferable futures fell into four broad categories: i) technocratic dreaming (uncritical acceptance, especially amongst boys, of techno-fix solutions for all problems); ii) demilitarisation and greening (of science and technology to meet genuine human needs); iii) intergenerational equity (accepting responsibility for future generations); and iv) making peace (with people and planet via a reconceptualisation of both ethics and lifestyles). These are very powerful images for young people who said they had learnt little about futures in school.
- Youth Futures
- A most welcome addition to this comparative research is Gidley and Inayatullah‚Äôs (2002) Youth Futures in which Eckersley (2002) has a chapter on Australian youth. He reports that the future most young Australians want is neither the future they expect, nor the future they are promised. Most do not expect Australian society to be better than today in 2010. They see a society driven by greed whilst what they would like is one motivated by generosity. Their dreams are for a society that places less emphasis on the individual, material wealth and competition, and more on community and family, the environment and co-operation. The belief that life would improve is a minority position and pessimism increases with age; those in their 20s are more negative than those in their teens. In an earlier account of this research, Eckersley (1999) concludes ‚ÄúYoung people‚Äôs preferred futures are undoubtedly idealised and utopian. Their significance lies in what they reveal about fundamental human needs ... and what they expect and what is being offered to them by world and national leaders‚Äù.
- It is clear from the above that much of the existing research on young people and the future relates to Western societies so that, as yet, limited cross-cultural comparisons can be made. Research on youth futures is also, by definition, less likely to look at age differences than work done in schools. Two contrasting studies deal with Japan and Singapore. Wright (2002) examines the role of contemporary Japanese youth in challenging traditional values and argues that their ‚Äòcool resistance‚Äô may enable them to rewrite a future that has already been colonised by their parents‚Äô culture. In a different vein, Oehlers (2002) explores how political and cultural pressures in Singapore have largely stifled any youth disaffection so that any debate about alternative futures is almost impossible.
- TEACHER EDUCATION
- A Global Dimension
- For futures education to have a greater impact on schools it is clear that initial and on-going teacher education are crucial arenas to influence. The obstacles in teacher education, however, are likely to be similar to those in schools. I thus think it is tactically easier, in schools and teacher education, to get people thinking first about the need for a ‚Äòglobal dimension‚Äô in the curriculum (where are we now?) and then to go on to consider the need for a ‚Äòfutures perspective‚Äô (what may happen as a consequence?). Thus, rather than starting with the future and explaining its importance in relation to the global issues in the present, one begins by looking at the state of the world in the present which automatically leads on to questions about the future (Hicks & Holden, 2007). What‚Äôs happening now will always be more tangible than what has yet to come. An example of this in terms of educational policy and practice comes from my own institution, Bath Spa University in the UK.
- Traditionally, undergraduates training to be teachers in England used to take a degree which focused rather narrowly on the National Curriculum and the professional training of teachers. Increasingly, a number of universities have replaced this with a 3+1 route, i.e., a three-year degree (Education Studies as single honours or Education with a subject specialism as joint honours) followed by a one-year post-graduate Certificate in Education‚Äîwhich is where their professional training now occurs. Those who do this at Bath Spa are guaranteed a global perspective in their modular programme because it forms a key strand in the Education Studies degree. The School of Education specifically chose this strategy in order to bring breadth and depth back to the study of education.
- Modules are arranged in three strands ~ A: Learning and curriculum; B: Teaching, settings and structures; C: Global and international. Education students have to choose modules from each of these groups, so all of them will have some understanding of the need for and nature of a global perspective. In their first year all students take a compulsory module entitled Education for Change which explores three main themes: i) the nature and purposes of education; ii) the current state of the world; and iii) the need for a global and futures dimension in the curriculum. The ‚Äòinternational‚Äô modules explore the nature of education in different cultural settings. The ‚Äòglobal‚Äô modules focus on contemporary global issues and concerns. These include futures, citizenship, human rights, and sustainability.
- A Futures Perspective
- Description
- Table 2. ED2013 Education for the Future
- ‚ÄòFutures in education‚Äô is the shorthand term used internationally by educators who believe that one of the main tasks of education is to prepare young people for a future that will necessarily be very different from today. In the UK teachers are more likely to talk about ‚Äòeducation for the future‚Äô when they express this concern. This module will introduce you to the crucial need for a futures perspective in schools and the ways in which this can be used to enhance pupils‚Äô learning. It will look at how young people feel about the future, locally and globally, and ways in which images of the future affect what we feel is worth doing in the present. It will explore the nature of both probable and preferable futures in the early 21st century and encourage you to think more critically and creatively about your personal and professional futures.

- Issues Arising
- EPILOGUE
- There are two quite different issues that I would like to raise here. The first is to do with the significance of what we are learning from the research and the second is procedural in the sense of how best to influence teachers and educational policy makers.
- Whilst we now know more about what young people think about the future, we are only just beginning to engage with what that might mean. Eckersley (2002, p. 32) highlights the difficulties when he writes:
- There is little doubt that many qualities that future fears might intuitively be expected to influence‚Äîhope, purpose and meaning in life, coherence, efficacy, or agency‚Äîare important to well-being. However, we may never be able to do more than suggest this because of the difficulty of disentangling concerns about the fate of the earth from the many other factors that influence these qualities, and hence well-being.
- He further notes important qualifications to the belief that global pessimism might be eroding young people‚Äôs well being. Firstly, the direction of any causal relationship between future pessimism and diminished well being can run two ways. Young people may feel pessimistic about the future because of their experience of the world now; at the same time, if depression levels are increasing in society then future visions are likely to become more pessimistic. Secondly, the wider research on well being shows that most people report satisfaction with their lives and that this is most influenced by family, work, friends and leisure. Thirdly, pessimism is only one of several cultural traits in modern Western society that are inimical to well being, including consumerism, deconstructive postmodernism and individualism.
- Futures education has as yet to make a significant impact in schools despite a range of important initiatives instigated by committed educators in different countries (e.g., Gidley et al., 2004; Morgan, 2006). In this respect, unfortunately, I have to take issue with Slaughter (2002) who argues that there has been a shift from ‚Äòrhetoric to reality‚Äô in schools and that futures is emerging into the educational mainstream. The list, however, is still the ‚Äòusual suspects‚Äô‚Äîa handful of innovative educators in the US, Australia and the UK‚Äîbut not yet a sea change in the wider educational system. One of my measures of this, as I mentioned earlier, is that futures education still seldom makes it into the list of ‚Äòissue-based educations‚Äô that socially committed educators around the world are conversant with.
- Global education is an interesting case in point. It is an international educational field that has at least a 30 year history, its own professional organisations and publications, conferences, alliances, documents, agendas, official policies and curriculum frameworks (Oxfam, 2006; Pike, 2000; DfES, 2005). Most of this effort is aimed at primary and secondary schools and teacher education. If there are lessons here for futures education, it could be that it may take years of dedicated work before the need for a ‚Äòfutures perspective‚Äô is as widely accepted as the need for a ‚Äòglobal dimension‚Äô in the curriculum. This requires a younger generation of futures educators to be also involved in that struggle. An alternative, of course, is that futures educators should infiltrate other issue-based educations and ensure that they each contain a futures element (Hicks, 2004).
- A good example of this can be found in environmental education, where a recent review of empirical studies of learners and learning (Rickinson, 2001) included a section on young people‚Äôs views of the future. Conversely, I was intrigued to read a recent biography of Elise Boulding (Morrison, 2001) which was written in terms of her contribution to peace education and feminist research but made no reference to her vital work on futures. One of the most useful entry points for those educators interested in a ‚Äòfutures perspective‚Äô could still be global education. Pike and Selby, influential theorists in this field, have long argued for a model of global education that contains four main elements: an issues dimension; a spatial dimension; a temporal dimension; and a process dimension. This model is described in Pike and Selby (1999) together with a range of practical classroom activities.
- Research Needed
- The field of futures education is still under-researched and there are many crucial issues and themes awaiting investigation. Even an initial list of basic research that needs to be done (Hicks, 2006) is quite a long one (see Table 3).
- Table 3. Research needed in futures education
- Images of the future
- ‚Ä¢	How do children conceptualise time and the future and how does this vary with age?
- ‚Ä¢ How do children‚Äôs views of the future vary by gender?
- ‚Ä¢ How do children‚Äôs views of the future vary by social class?
- ‚Ä¢ How do children‚Äôs views of the future vary by ethnic group?
- ‚Ä¢ What is the nature of children‚Äôs probable and preferred futures?
- ‚Ä¢ What emerges from cross-cultural comparisons of the above?
- NB. Views of the future could be broken down into personal, local, national and global.
- Media influences on images
- What images of the future are conveyed by children‚Äôs books, comics and computer games?
- What images of the future are conveyed by TV advertising?
- What images of the future have been conveyed by popular movies over the last 25 years?
- How do such images relate to issues of gender, age, class and Western culture?
- Image and action
- How do images of the future affect attitudes and behaviour in the present? What determines reactive or proactive stances in relation to the future?
- What changes in attitude and behaviour arise from extended futures-orientated work in a school or classroom?
- What do teaching materials that encourage skills of participation and responsible action look like for different age groups?
- Resources and policy
- What do appropriate teaching materials look like for different subject areas and how can subject specialists be encouraged to develop them?
- Which futures methodologies are most useful in the classroom and how can they be related to a range of other learning outcomes?
- How can head teachers, school governors and parents be persuaded of the need for a futures dimension in the curriculum?
- What educational bodies and which key players would need to be influenced in order to gain official backing for such a dimension in the curriculum?
- This is in no way intended to be a complete list but it highlights a range of initial research possibilities.
- And Finally
- There is no clear body of opinion within mainstream education that understands or supports the need for a futures perspective in schools. It is still the domain of a loose international network of socially committed educators. Future steps that need to be taken could include the following:
- ‚Äì Creation internationally of a seed group of educators specifically committed to futures education, possibly as an offshoot of the World Futures Studies Federation.
- ‚Äì Creation nationally of networks of teachers and teacher educators committed to futures education.
- ‚Äì Setting up alliances, nationally and internationally, with colleagues working in global education, social education, education for sustainability.
- ‚Äì The development of teaching materials for different age groups and subject areas that embody the principles of futures education.
- ‚Äì Working with professional groups (e.g., teachers, head teachers, subject specialists) to incorporate a futures perspective in policy documents.
- ‚Äì Offering professional development programmes to schools, local authorities, curriculum development bodies and other national bodies.
- ‚Äì Identifying key players in education who need to be inducted into the principles and practice of futures education.
- ‚Äì Circulating nationally and internationally, via conferences and newsletters, examples of successful practice at all levels of education.
- If official recognition of a global perspective in the UK is anything to go, by achieving the same for a futures perspective could yet take some time. Is there enough commitment internationally to attempt this? Who are the key players and where are they now? Who would be natural allies? What and where are the pressure points which need to be worked on? And how can the wider field of futures studies support those working in schools and teacher education to begin such a programme?
-
- In discussing William Morris‚Äôs great utopian novel, News from Nowhere, Coleman and O‚ÄôSullivan (1990, p.10) write:
- Let us imagine that life is not as it is, but as it one day might be. Let us inspect the unknown terrain of the future, as if we are about to inhabit it ... the imagined future is a subversive force: the more who imagine a different kind of future, and imagine constructively, materially and determinedly, the more dangerous utopian dreams become. They grow from dreams to aims.
- Morris, I suspect, would be delighted to know that in the early twenty-first century these concerns are still alive and at the heart of the academic field of futures studies‚Äîand futures education in schools.

- Abstract
- Abstract
- Since the 1960s many people have attempted to introduce different aspects of futures into education but surprisingly few initiatives have survived. The paper considers one that took place in Queensland in the late 1990s. It suggests why bureaucracies have thus far mishandled such socially vital innovations and comments on the social and human costs. Factors from commerce, pedagogy and the global system are advanced to sug- gest why futures need to become a mainstream concern in education systems at all levels.

- Quote from Pre-Pilot Senior Syllabus in Futures, Board of Senior Secondary School Studies, Brisbane, April 1998, pp. 1-2
- Preamble
- The study of Futures is intellectually stimulating and seeks to empower students. It draws on the innate capacity of the human mind to engage in foresight, or futures thinking enhanced by concepts, tools and techniques. When this enhanced capacity to engage with 'the future' is implemented in specific areas ... Futures can contribute substantially to social and economic well-being. Students who take this course will be encouraged to transform their view of the world. As they develop informed foresight about the 21st century they may experience many shifts of value, focus and atti- tude and they should discover that most fears, negative attitudes and 'doomsday' images of the future rest on misperceptions. In learning how present actions will shape future consequences, stu- dents gain access to new sources of understanding and action...
- Futures also address the critical issues of late adolescence and provides a valuable preparation for working life. Therefore, instead of looking ahead to the world beyond school with anxiety and fear, students will be able to look ahead with much greater clarity and confidence. Such attitudes and skills clearly provide a sound basis for decision making...
- Citizens of tomorrow need to be prepared for a world which will be significantly different from the world of the 1990's: a world characterised by rapid technological change, major environmental challenges, globalism and expanding information net- works. This syllabus provides the opportunity for students to develop the skills that will enable them to develop leadership in shaping their own future and Australia's.

- The Story that Connects
- The range of change processes can appear bewildering because they operate across many different domains. That is why change analysts and foresight practitioners have adopted various methods for managing this complexity. 1
- A central claim of this article is that, equipped with this resource, it is well within the capacity of human societies to respond. A well-grounded and informed futures perspective goes a long way beyond allowing us to propose a variety of actions to preserve the environment, vital as this is. It also provides the tools to understand deeper issues like the fallacies of economic growth and discerns some of the more subtle drivers of unsustainable outlooks within the heart of the Western worldview itself (Berman, 1981; Slaughter, 2004).

- How Bureaucracies De-focus the Future And Undermine Innovation
- How Bureaucracies De-focus the Future And Undermine Innovation
- The first, fairly obvious, point to make is that bureaucracies are not designed to to be forward thinking. They exist to carry out a range of administrative tasks in the here and now as dictated by past practice and current political realities. The Directors and CEOs of such organisations must first and foremost serve their current political masters or they are quickly out of a job. In working with such entities it is striking to see how the focus of attention is not only short-term but also largely internal.
- Broadly speaking they are not densely connected to the wider world but operate unthinkingly within a pre-defined sense of what has been called 'bounded rationality'. They are pro- foundly rational, and there are reasons for everything, but reality is deeply filtered and simplified. There are two immediate implications for the topic under discussion.
- First, approaches to 'the future' when they do occur, tend to be stereotypical.
- Second, as I will show below, innovations with any potential for deep-seated change are quickly marginalised.
- Over several decades what has become clear is that government departments, bureaucracies, decision-makers in school systems are far more comfortable with initiatives addressing the futures of education. The basic reason for this is that such exercises are largely extrapolative, tend not to question bureaucratic assumptions and do little to question or challenge existing educational practice. On the other hand, approaches that consider futures in education introduce dynamic new features into present-day administration, theory and practice. Thus, overall, it tends to end up in the 'too hard' basket despite its many positive implications (Hicks, 2002; Gidley et al., 2004).
- A second point about bureaucracies is that they do not welcome innovations 'from the outside', as it were. Many futures initiatives I've known of, or been involved in, worked very well at the school level and were enthusiastically embraced. But as soon as one moves beyond particular schools to the system level everything changes. Here futures in education initiatives seem to vanish like smoke on a windy day and are seen no more. Perhaps the central reason for this is that school systems are governed, in turn, by two powerful sets of background forces that have no real interest at all in education or, indeed, our collective futures. Those forces are politics and economics. In fact education, politics and economics are themselves mediated through an ideological framework that has become hegemonic over recent decades (Milojevic, 2005). This managerialist, market oriented, growth-addicted view of the world has actively worked to de-focus and hold back many useful social innovations, not only this one (Fisher, 2006). The result is that teachers in schools (and let us not forget, teachers and learners in very many other locations) have been undermined by these background forces that all-too-often lie out of sight and unregarded. Bringing futures work in education back into focus and freshly comprehending its individual and cultural value is indeed a challenging task. Yet it is a vital step toward a worthwhile future for humankind.

- A specific example - Board of Senior Secondary School Studies (BSSSS)
- A specific example occurred in Queensland, Australia, during the mid-1990s when I made many trips from Melbourne to Brisbane to chair a committed convened by the then Board of Senior Secondary School Studies (BSSSS). The committee had been formed following a government report that had recommended a more explicitly futures-oriented approach (Queensland Government, 1994). The result, after about two years' work was a detailed outline of a two-year subject for Years 11 and 12 called: Futures Personal, Social, Global (BSSSS, 1995). The subject was put out for trial in a number of Queensland schools and a formal evaluation was undertaken (Underwood, 1996).

- It's worth noting some of the reasons provided to the official evaluator by the schools for choosing to trial the draft subject:
- Ùè∞Ä at each school there is a teacher or teachers enthusiastic about the challenge of this innovative syllabus;
   -
- Ùè∞Ä the subject is seen as a means of making available the skills of the humanities' disciplines as students move from traditional disciplines to new technology based subjects;
   - ÔøΩ
- ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ Futures is seen as being relevant to the needs of students in a changing world. They will learn to cope with change by understanding it; and
   - ÔøΩ
- ÔøΩ The subject offers opportunity for students to acquire and develop in the areas of basic competencies and the core curriculum elements (p. 3).

   - Equal
- ly interesting are the reasons given by students themselves for wishing to take the subject:
   - Ùè∞Ä
- the content of the course is appealing;
   - Ùè∞Ä th
- e belief that students should develop an active relationship with the future;
   - Ùè∞Ä (it
- is) the best subject available on the subject choice line;
   - Ùè∞Ä the be
- lief that it would help them to get an overall position in the Student Evaluation Profile needed to obtain tertiary entrance; and
   - Ùè∞Ä the expe
- ctation that it would be helpful or needed in a future job (p. 4).

   - summary of

- evaluation
   - While it can be
- argued that creating a new Futures subject is not the only, nor even the best option, clearly this one was going to be a success. The summary of the evaluation highlighted the following points:
   - Ùè∞Ä an 'encour
- aging number of students' had taken part;
   - Ùè∞Ä the teachers
- involved were 'highly qualified in a number of disciplines';
   - Ùè∞Ä there was 'fav
- ourable parent reaction' to the work carried out;
   - Ùè∞Ä the trial subjec
- t offered 'attractive and innovative learning experiences';
   - Ùè∞Ä teachers were havi
- ng 'some difficulties with the assessment of students in group work';
   - Ùè∞Ä there were some conc
- erns about 'insufficient detail in the curriculum document'; 
   - Ùè∞Ä also, 'locating and ad
- apting resources for classroom use are concerns';
   - Ùè∞Ä yet there was also an im
- pressive enthusiasm for the new subject amongst Administrators, Heads of Department and Teachers; and, finally,
   - Ùè∞Ä 'this new and innovative s
- ubject is being enthusiastically received in the trial schools and, though there have been some difficulties and concerns, is progressing satisfactorily' (p. 10).

However, this driving force was ultimately eclipsed by the motivation from the desire to achieve something that I have never tried before. It really opened my eyes. Having the occasion to teach others about the Futures Field forced me to re-think what it means to me, and my relationship with its role now and in the future. In a sense it restored a feeling of 'awe' that I initially experienced when I first encountered the field, and has cleared away a lot of the baggage and associations that accumulated throughout the year. The fact that it has occurred through a blossoming and thriving new medium has been a bonus and I feel that I have learned a great deal about my own capabilities... (Rundle, 1996).

   - If there is a summary statement t

   - As time goes by it becomes increa
- singly clear that the lack of an explicit futures perspective in any curriculum ‚Äì be it 'traditional' or 'progressive' - leads to the same general consequences, ie, a new generation of students lacking any real grasp of the human predicament and of the ways it can be addressed. 
   - 
   - First, for any organisation i
- nter
- ested in understanding broad processes of change, systematic scanning of the environment (a precursor to disciplined forward thinking) is both possible and highly desirable. Second, the skills involved have been around for some time, are not particularly esoteric and could easily be widely adopted if the will was there to do so. Consider, therefore, the following passage that describes a typical early morning meeting at a large international merchant bank:
   - ...Seated round the table are peo
- ple who have got to the top of their product speciality at the world's biggest financial players. These people know what they are doing, and they know everything there is to know about their product area. They get together daily; they are not discussing the weather or the sports scores, they are discussing business threats and opportunities, 'anticipated market movements' to use one of their favourite phrases. These are real-life, dynamic meetings not dull bureaucratic risk-control affairs. These are firms in a state of 'constant communication' ... not just in the meetings but outside too, using the informal networks that the organisational structure develops...This is an industry taking a great deal of trouble to join up the dots at every conceivable level (Augar, 2006, p. 113).
   - Although I've not visited more th
- an a tiny fraction of the world's educational bureaucracies, I'd venture to suggest that not one of them has meetings of this kind anywhere, at any time, whose purpose is to scan broadly and 'connect the dots'. We've already seen why. Like the governments they serve, [educational bureaucracies[ are simply not alert to dynamic shifts in the macro-environment. Nor, on the whole, do they have the skills that this alertness requires. 
   - Bureaucracies serve as agents of
- government policy for social administration in the here and now. In this role of 'minding the shop' they have no interest in, nor any capability for, forward thinking. It is simply not within their remit or job description. One could argue that they are concerned with continuity, not with change. So when ideas, people, books, curriculum innovations with some of these features appear, a well-oiled 'immune system' not dissimilar to the white cells in the human bloodstream, is activated and the 'invaders' are repelled. Yet for those with eyes to see, historically unprecedented changes can be clearly discerned 'in the pipeline' or, to change the metaphor, 'tsunamis of change' can be seen moving steadily toward us from the near future (Dator, 1992). What therefore are some appropriate responses?
   - Forward-looking Educational Respo
- nses
   - A number of educational thinkers
- and writers have addressed this issue and come to similar conclusions. For example, Peters covers much of the relevant territory in his paper on Educational Policy Futures (Peters, 2005). What is clear from this and simi- lar sources is that the grounds for including explicit futures perspectives within educational administration and school curricula are now compelling. Ironically, this case was made quite explicitly in what became known as the Wiltshire Report commis- sioned by the Queensland Government in the 1990s (Queensland Government, 1994). An overview document states very clearly that 'the Panel recommends that every syl- labus in every subject should have a futures perspective, tackling new timely topics and crucial current social issues' (p. 5). One reason this did not occur is that there was no real support for it in the bureaucracy, which continued along its well-worn 'busi- ness-as-usual' path, with the results discussed above.
   - In contrast to this sad and famil
- iar picture it seems rather obvious to suggest that educational bureaucracies need to be re-designed (not re-structured along similar lines) for a very different world. It is a world that is, or should be, informed by what I termed 'the story that connects'. It is simply no longer good enough for large-scale economic interests to draw on advanced thinking and innovative practice for commer- cial gain while educational interests continue to lag decades behind. The environmen- tal scanning capabilities, the same global connectivity and the sense of urgency to 'connect the dots' should now be designed into school systems. This means new struc- tures, new operational units, new job descriptions and a new, or renewed, sense of 'what education is about' in the early 21st Century (Beare & Slaughter, 1993).
   - Another way to approach this ques
- tion at the system level is to consider how strategic foresight differs from old-style planning. One definition of strategic foresight is:
   - The ability to create and maintai
- n high quality, coherent and functional forward views and to use the insights arising in organisationally useful ways. For exam- ple, to detect adverse conditions, guide policy, shape strategy, and to explore new markets, products and services (Slaughter, 1999, p. 287).
   - Most, if not all, educational bur
- eaucracies have some sort of planning and / or strategy function, albeit one that is inward looking and stereotypical. On the other hand our understanding of foresight has developed rapidly in recent years and we can now regard it as a human capacity with considerable power when it is properly devel- oped and applied. Thus, the process of adding 'foresight' to planning and / or strategy is profoundly enlivening and can readily be seen to 'refresh' the latter. It does do by bringing into play ideas, methods and capabilities that had earlier been overlooked. Moreover, there are sufficient case studies available to demonstrate these gains in capability very clearly (Slaughter, 2007). Such changes are needed at the highest lev- els ‚Äì from ministers to department heads to professors in universities ‚Äì before innova- tions at the school level can thrive.
   - Thus far I've argued that FE is m
- andated by threats to human civilisation that are now rebounding upon humanity from an over-stressed global system. But we should also be clear that the intrinsic value to young people provides equally powerful grounds for innovations of this kind.
   -   What Does Futures In Education
- Offer Young People?
   - Again, this is not new. The many
- constructive consequences of teaching and learning explicitly within a futures mode are well understood and documented (Hicks, 2002). It has long been understood that for young people 'the future' is a topic of deep and abiding concern. For example, one researcher looking at the experiences of teenage girls recently reported that: 'every single girl had these massive feelings of doubt. A lot of them ask: "what am I doing here? Do I have a future and what is it?" ' (Sullivan, 2007) All are, quite reasonably, interested in the unfolding of their own lives and not a few can see that there are a number of issues that give rise to concern, if not outright fear.
   - Unfortunately, however, it has be
- en the case that young peoples' images of futures are largely and one-sidedly derived from the mass media: films, computer games, TV and Internet subcultures, with few resources available to process or mediate their implicit and explicit content, and with all-too-familiar results. A 2007 survey found that:
   - The future most young Australians
- want is neither the future they expect nor the future they are promised under current national priorities... Most ... see the expected or probable future of humankind largely in terms of a continuation or worsening of today's global and national problems and difficulties. The probable future is also the problematic future (Eckersley et al, 2007, p. 13).
   - While such images are certainly n
- ot without value when considered carefully, they also tend to exert a distinctly negative influence. Hence many young people grow up fearing the future, learning to avoid it, and unaware of either its positive potentials or the many ways that they could act to address issues of concern. On the other hand, FE provides the perspectives and understandings that provide a basis for many long- term solutions to the human predicament: active foresight, sustainable cultures, stew- ardship of the Earth. If we recall the 'feeling of awe' and the 'clearing away of (mental) baggage' mentioned above by the student from a trial school, one can readily detect the kind of fruitful engagement between alert youngsters and the challenges ahead that stand at the heart of 'effective schooling'.
   - What's currently missing from edu
- cational thinking and practice is a specifically futures discourse. It is absent from the highest levels of executive decision making, from universities and professional associations and also from classrooms. Yet it is growing mastery here that actually provides the symbolic starting points to move 'the future' from being a domain of fear and avoidance to one of agency and personal power. The point is that even a very basic familiarity with, and competence in, a futures discourse has catalytic effects. In a nutshell, and most centrally, it 'unlocks' the Futures domain and catalyses human and social potential. What does this mean? Ideas that seemed vague are clarified (eg, how human foresight can become a princi- ple of great social utility and power); global problems that seemed 'too hard' now admit a range of solutions (eg, peak oil and alternatives for an over-dependent world); the links between individual and collective action are revealed (eg, how political sys- tems can be influenced through various forms of 'right action') and so on. It is appropriate, therefore, to return to the 'good news' mentioned above, ie, the starting points for a futures discourse are simple, straightforward and well within the capacity of every young person. Given the chance, all young people can understand concepts such as the following:
   - Ùè∞Ä the use of foresight in ever
- yday life;
   - Ùè∞Ä the use of different time fram
- es for different purposes;
   - Ùè∞Ä exploring the 200 year present (
- stretching 100 back and forward); Ùè∞Ä the use of simple tools such as time lines and futures wheels; and Ùè∞Ä how to change fears into motivation.
   - This is merely a small sample of the resour
- ces available (Slaughter & Bussey, 2006).
   - At first sight, and without the symbolic su
- pport of a futures discourse, the futures domain may appear either threatening or 'empty'. Yet the latter is an illusion woven from habit, linguistic traps (such as past, present, future tenses) and cultural assump- tions that have not been clearly reflected upon, problematised and re-framed. Solutions are not distant but, in fact, surprisingly close at hand. Anyone who looks at daily life carefully enough soon discovers that without a very personal mastery of applied foresight no one would rise from their bed each day. No one would go to school or work because they'd have lost all motivation and purpose. It's the fact of having an open future that makes it possible, indeed, requires us, to think, evaluate and plan ahead in virtually everything we do. Understanding this makes it a good deal easier to explore the implications of futures enquiry and informed action at the organi- sational and social levels.
   - The key point is this: exploring the future
- s domain at a range of levels provides some of the most valuable ways to get to grips with human life and culture in time. Despite a current preoccupation with 'back to basics' in school curricula around the world and the false sense of security that it provides to some, forward thinking should be seen as a core skill, requirement and focus at every level of every school system. This was the conclusion reached by the Wiltshire Report in Queensland in 1994 and subsequent events have only served to confirm its veracity. Executive decision-makers need an immersion in Futures so that they can become attuned to the meaning of sig- nals of change in the wider world. Teacher educators need it because successive gen- erations of teachers are preparing young people for a progressively altered world. Young people themselves need it because they face a number of powerful systemic challenges, any of which could bring the species to its knees, and they need to be pre- pared (Slaughter, 2006).
   - Beyond denial, avoidance and repression
   -
- It was suggested above there have been many
- curriculum innovations directed at bringing futures thinking and perspectives into educational thinking and practice but hitherto they have generally been marginalised. The Queensland trial subject in Futures is a case in point. The common strategies of denial, avoidance and repression of unwanted knowledge screen out uncomfortable truths at every level and in every sector of society. Now, however, 'signals' from the global system regarding conflict, climate change, water supply, chronic over-dependence on cheap oil ‚Äì these and many others ‚Äì are confronting everyone with facts that can no longer be ignored. We are liv- ing through the most profound, many-stranded, global transition in history. It is one in which the human species needs to pay close attention to the many 'signals' emerging from the global system. According to the Meadows team three basic responses are available:
   - Ùè∞Ä deny, disguise or confuse the signals;
- Ùè∞Ä alleviate the pressures from limits by t
- echnical or economic fixes; or
   - Ùè∞Ä acknowledge that the human socio-economic
- system as currently structured is
   - unmanageable and seek to change the structure of
- the system. (Meadows, 2005,
   - pp. 235-6)
   - Any look at the mass media will fin
- d the first so
- lution highlighted clearly and
   - often. A particularly obnoxious example is The Au
- stralian newspaper's monthly glossy high-end publication called Wish Magazine. At an estimated cost of perhaps Aud$2 million per year, it engages the best visuals and advertising talent to, in effect, push the message that 'you, too, deserve the very same lifestyles as the rich and famous.' It is a futile and counter-productive message that perversely works against any shared social interest in a more sane and equitable world. Why? Because, if we were smart, we would not be expending wealth generated during the temporary sum- mer of oil's peak on further stimulating yet higher levels of consumption. Instead we'd be investing those very same temporary riches in adapting to a changed world. Similarly, a quick scan of the news will reveal many technical and economic fixes designed to facilitate more growth and development in an already-stressed system. The third response ‚Äì changing the structure of the system ‚Äì is currently beyond the capability of present day decision-making, even though it is where we need to go. The fact is that it may only be invoked when one or more sufficiently serious 'inflections' in the world system (such as a stock market crash, a human pandemic or a large-scale environmental catastrophe) reveal the poverty of present practices. Clearly 'social learning' of this magnitude will be a very expensive exercise indeed. But we would be foolish to merely sit back and wait...
   - To deal successfully with global challenges of th
- e scale we are facing requires much broader understanding of the human context than currently exists in govern- ments and bureaucracies anywhere. Societies need time to respond. If it is only through the careful use of informed foresight that we can create time and space to deal with such complicated and challenging issues, then the sooner school systems begin using and teaching it at every level, as appropriate, the better. Clearly, we are not speaking here merely about a curriculum change but changes in the deep structures of our understanding of the world (Wilber, 1995).
   - Conclusion
   - School systems have been run, by an
- d large, as if
- the future remained open and unproblematic. That was once a reasonable assumption but it no longer is. The future of humanity is currently under greater threat than most are willing admit. Yet as the costs of not understanding the 'great transition' progressively mount, so the rationale for thinking ahead becomes increasingly obvious. School systems need to face these facts. They need a more dynamic and responsive structure, including their own envi- ronmental scanning systems that are different from, but as effective as, those routinely operated in commercial environments. They need to value and use the futures frame- works, methods and tools that have been available for some time. Beginning teachers need to be introduced to futures concepts and tools suitable for classroom use. They also need to develop their own specifically futures-oriented understanding more fully than ever before
   - It is only when changes of this kind are well und
- er way that school systems can legitimately claim that they are preparing young people appropriately for their future lives. Only then will young people begin to be properly equipped for the manifestly challenging tasks ahead. The 'bottom line' is that there is nothing inevitable about the journey of the human race from its origins in the distant past onward into the future. Equally, however, there is nothing inevitable about the current 'overshoot and collapse' trajectory, the 'fall into Dystopia', either. While schools are by no means the only, or even the most powerful, actors involved it seems to me that they have a pivotal role to play in helping humanity decide just how to respond to the growing global dilemma that surrounds us.

   - Th
- e future, after all, is an open space, a space
- that must be made personal, decolonised from institutions and structures which intend to make it their own, as well as from theories which claim history and future has ended, that imagination has been stricken from history, leaving only technique, the task of implementing social design. Futures studies, as this tour intends to articulate, is about keeping the future always a step ahead of our desire to totalize, to concretize; after all, as we violate each other and nature, maintaining the dream of a different type of society, of a renaissance that leads to the ever awakening of vision, is a hope that must remain free and open, always more than our ability to attain it.

Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.‚Äù

   - eg. Teach a man to fish, factory schooling, facto

   - ‚Äúinvesting in the future‚Äù
   - Within each of t
- hese metaphors, there are ‚Äúsub-
- metaphors‚Äù eg. factory farming (caged chickens, feed lots, monoculture) or family farming, organic, indigenous
   -  ie. If we used a farming metaphor, what sort of
- farm would your school be? What would be the diet(curriculum) your farm favours or serves?
   - For a factory metaphor, what sort of factory?
   -
- Cheap labour, repetitive tasks, time-pressured
   -
- A production line? 
   - 
   - But I‚Äôm not stopping
- at metaphor. In explor
- ing
- the metaphor, I am simultaneously exploring the factories(work), fishing/farming (food) and finance (resources) systems of the future.
   - Then, perhaps (though I need to think this throug
- h more carefully) I am also critiquing these future techs/systems, or alternatively, providing a warning of what features must they incorporate. (I‚Äôm not sure how this critique will happen/arise yet)

   - Within each of t

- metaphors‚Äù eg. factory farming (caged chickens, feed lots, monoculture) or family farming, organic, indigenous
   -  ie. If we used a farming metaphor, what sort of

   - For a factory metaphor, what sort of factory?
   -
- Cheap labour, repetitive tasks, time-pressured
   -
- A production line? 
   - 
   - But I‚Äôm not stopping
- at metaphor. In explor
- ing
- the metaphor, I am simultaneously exploring the factories(work), fishing/farming (food) and finance (resources) systems of the future.
   - Then, perhaps (though I need to think this throug
