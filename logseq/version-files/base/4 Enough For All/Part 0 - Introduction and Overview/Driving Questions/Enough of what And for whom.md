Enough of everything, for everyone and every thing.
Possible Perhaps not. Perhaps there needs to be definition of critical thresholds, feasible ranges and realistic acceptances. But is the ideal worth pursuing Definitely. Absolutely. Let's get the general ideal though
	• Not every individual can have a car and have the world work well. But everyone can have transport.
	• Not every one always gets the government they want, but they could have a fair say.
	• Not every one can be famous, but everyone can feel illuminated and secure.
	•	Not every thing can live to 100, but every thing's life could be respected and appreciated.
Enough For All will consider layers of purpose and objective so that constraints are acknowledge and realities accepted.
