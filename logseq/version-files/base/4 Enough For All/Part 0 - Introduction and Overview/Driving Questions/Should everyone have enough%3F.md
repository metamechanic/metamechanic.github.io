If there is, in theory, enough for all, as a global sum or average, should everyone have enough
title:: Should everyone have enough?
It is the position of the Enough For All project that yes, we could and should aspire to everyone having enough. However, this is clearly not the position of all parties. The thinking here is of winner-loser; that in order for me to have, others must have less. I can only gain by another's loss. This consciousness might then precipitate another set of questions
	•	Can I profit further by my fellow having enough Can I gain, in ways that I value, from my brother's gain
	•	Could my temporary "sacrifice" and "donation" to the needy actually generate benefit for me and my group rather than a sense of deprivation
	•	Does everyone having enough open up possibilities of more for everyone
EFA will help to share such theory, modelling and examples to address these questions.
