The central intuition and idea of this work is that  1. We are looking in the wrong place for this source of peace and fulfillment. 2. A more effective Source does exist and is accessible to all.  We seek satisfaction in or through food, chocolate, alcohol, drugs, sex, a particular body image, stimulation from enterntainment media, “fitting in” and many other things which may harm ourselves. We can also seek a sense of satisfaction via things which produce control and power over, or harm of, others material possessions, intellectual correctness, ideological superiority, torture and murder and the list goes on.  Yet EFA, guided and inspired by many works before it [link] asserts that this pattern is back to front and inside out. The fundamental proposition is that if we first seek love/security/identity within then we will experience enough outside in the world.   
Instead of first seeking satisfaction in that object/body/action and ultimately failing (which is the inevitable outcome, even if it takes a long time), we can connect with something within us that provides genuine, lasting satisfaction as well as inspiration and guidance for acting in the world.  This continual connection and sourcing within ourselves, within our own minds, begins a fulfilling spiral of joy and peace that will effortlessly spread.  This is not only the theory underlying Enough For All but is also probably the reason you and I are here, on this webpage, as well as in this world.
