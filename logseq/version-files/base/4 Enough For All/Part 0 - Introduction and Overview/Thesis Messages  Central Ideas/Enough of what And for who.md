Enough of what And for who Everyone lacks. Everyone everywhere is lacking something. For much of the world (we’ll get into some detail shortly) it may be the basic material requirements in life sufficient food, clean water, adequate housing, warm clothing. It may be other intangible but equally fundamental freedoms from imprisonment, oppression, discrimination, persecution, enslavement and torture. Yet for affluent members of the industrialised world, lack is glaringly obvious as well. You don’t need to look too hard to find lack of genuine love, peace of mind, joy, kindness & compassion, inner security and fulfillment. These characteristics are rare. Where they exist, their limits are also readily apparent. Everyone everywhere is lacking something.
