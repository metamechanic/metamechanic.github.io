There are a number of reasons EFA exists as a blog and hopefully as a book in the near future…  
Personal curiosity around the driving questions. 
Social contribution Maybe I can help… 
Spiritual fulfillment 
I suspect my own fulfillment is linked to filling the bellies, pockets, hearts, minds and souls of as many as possible. 
I suspect the process may help uncover and illuminate my own resistance to enough in myself, and for others. 
No one does not lack something. 
This project may help heal my own personal sense of poverty. 
Because I postulate there can be enough OF everything FOR every thing. And I postulate that we’re going the wrong way about satisfactorily accomplishing that. 
Why the bloody hell not Sometimes something just grips you and won’t let go.
