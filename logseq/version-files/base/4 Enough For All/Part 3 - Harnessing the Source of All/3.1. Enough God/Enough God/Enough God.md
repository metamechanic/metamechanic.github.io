Enough love
What is love (No. I think this should be its own chapter. The preceding chapter.) “Love” as defined by ACIM, is the conceptual link to “Enough God” through “limitlessness”  “Enough God” chapter may be a rephrasing, reinterpretation of “love”, “religion” and “spirituality”.  God occurs differently to different people Verticality Horizontality Form of practice and worship Must appeal to various groups whose “god” looks/feels/tastes different.  Everyone is seeking God, mostly unconsciously. The problem may be that  We don’t know that We don’t acknowledge that We don’t explicity, consciously, openly incorporate that into our systems, policy, organization, education etc...  This would be difficult, perhaps, because we don’t know concretely what God is. So, how do you incorporate It (or rather, how do you incorporate the search for It, or the practice of connecting/communicating with It.) (Thought It incorporates you.)  EFA is calling for re-interpretation of religion such that all insufficiency themes areno longer attributed to God ie. God does not favour a single people; God does not cause pestilence, disease, famine etc; God does not make the body...  “It is the human change which will transform the society. They are not two separate things.” – Krishnamurti.  “Where there is a division, there is conflict.” K  ACIM Lesson 131 “No one can fail who seeks to reach the truth.”
