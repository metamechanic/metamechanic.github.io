Donate & Assist Enough For All would like your help. Be it a financial contribution or provision of skills, I am seeking assistance to accelerate and improve the sharing of the message of EFA.  Like many apsiring authors and independent researchers setting out on their quest, I can’t give up my day job just yet. It might be a while before my visions become financially self-sustaining.  This doesn’t stop me for appealing for financial assistance to bring forward this process. If you believe in the message of EFA and its urgency, and are in a position to help, please get in touch.

Likewise, it will support other organisations that align with this purpose.  Similarly, I am also seeking assistance with other aspects of the project   web design and development skills  research-writing,   suggestions of data sources  any other insights
