Enough physical health, psycho-emotional health = enough love 
Enough Health Care Health/medical care systems, insurance etc 
Health/medical technology and techniques

This might be an example of reverse engineering causality. By this I mean, for example..
	1.	Display/communicate the current data and state of health in a particular group/region/demographic
	⁃	Diseases of affluence
	⁃	Mental health
	⁃	Diseases of poverty eg. Malaria, cholera
	⁃	Malnutrition
	⁃	Childbirth
	⁃	Cancer
	⁃	Accidents
	2.	What causes this condition(s)
	⁃	Diets
	⁃	Excess
	⁃	Insufficient
	⁃	Resource lack
	⁃	Resource quality
	⁃	etc
	3.	Then, display the data on these conditions outlined in step 2 above.
