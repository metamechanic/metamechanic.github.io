Technology Technology is an artefact/reflection of material and development Therefore, it is somewhat more “advanced” and could be included higher up in the chapter structure. Money might come under Tech section.  “Medicine” might come under Tech although “Health” wouldn’t.  Technology can be split/divided into 2 areas Machines, devices, software, tools Techniques using the same “old” tools = innovation, as well as the science and theory behind the machines. Therefore, “enough technology” can be spread over “enough stuff” (a) and “enough creativity/info/knowledge/ideas” This chapter starts with “machines and mechanisms as “technology” and transitions to “ideas as technology”, moving from the tangible to the intangible, gross to subtle The whole book’s structure flow is gross to subtle, tangible to intangible
