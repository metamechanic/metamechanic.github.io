Money Money can come under Technology. Actually, can it come under both  Devices/tools, as well as Techniques/Info Is money a thing (stuff) or is it more “technology”. That is, a non-tangible tool, like information Originally it was a thing eg. Shells, gems, gold etc. Now, that is different. Money itself doesn’t have inherent use except to burn as fuel, use as a paper weight, carve etc  It’s the significance/meaning we give to it that is important. Maybe Money is the link between enough stuff and enough technology as it is/was based on gold and rare metals, cattle, salt, beads, shells etc. “The nations’ problems are grounded not just in what we spend money on, but in what kind of money we use” futurenet.org/article.aspID=895 (accessed 24/5/05) Kind of money determines kind of transactions/exchanges “The only way to make a profit is to trade in something that is scarce.” Fastcompany.com/magazine/77/sgodin.html I want now what I may not be able to have in the future. When we realize we do not have something, we desire it. Jesus talks about money in the New Testament more than any other theme (apparently).
