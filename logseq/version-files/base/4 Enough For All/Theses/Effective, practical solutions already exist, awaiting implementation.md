Technologies and philosophies already exist which would act as part of effective, practical solutions.
They address one or more particular layers of reality. They fit together with other pieces addressing other layers, or they acknowledge and address all layers in themselves.
They often exist as outside popular culture, on the edge of educated orthodoxy, in the waste bin of ancient wisdom, on the fringe of dominant discourse or the too-hard basket of denial and repression.
