Welcome to Global Effort About Global Effort
Global Effort is an acronym for Global Energy Futures & FOResight Thinking.

Futures & Foresight
The term futures refers to time and not trading of energy commodities. Thus energy futures refers to images, visions, scenarios, strategies, roadmaps, forecasts, plans and the like around energy. Futures are what pull, push and steer us on the journey (dare I say forward?) These images and ideas inform our decisions in the present and thus futures awareness is critical.

Energy
In case it were not clear, energy refers to what powers society and its inter-related systems. This then refers to all tools and ideas involved in the use of fossil fuels, nuclear, renewables and other advanced technologies to harness, transform, generate, distribute and/or otherwise utilise energy. 
Given the scope of this work is global, energy also refers to human and animal labour and consequent food production & consumption. However, global, in the true sense of the word, does not refer only to place but should also include time (the past as well as the future) as well as the various means & methods we have of viewing all energy issues. Global is global in place, time and ideas.

Yet what powers society is not solely physical power but the images and purposes we ascribe to it. Here energy and futures carry a common metaphorical meaning. As such, these images cannot be removed from mundane technological, economic, political or other conventional energy considerations but must be proactively acknowledged and embraced.
Unification
Global EFFORT is thus not only an acronym, however. It symbolises what is probably required to resolve world energy issues:

A broader, deeper, (more) global view of energy issues
Many contributions and contributors from around the globe
Effort  that is, energy  from all of us, united in common purpose
Futures, foresight & alternative thinking to break the shackles of current, ineffective thinking

Notes
Global Effort is a continual work in progress. 
Pease comment and contribute. All parts of it can benefit from your thoughts.
Feel free to explore the site, investigating its many nooks and crannies.
What Global Effort is not
The intention of Global Effort is to offer some fresh perspectives, insights and thinking into the energy issues of the world. Therefore, it is the distinct objective of Global Effort not to replicate what exists elsewhere but to complement, enhance and leverage that. Therefore, Global Effort is not:

A wiki of energy technologies which will save the world. Global Effort might explore how this view might contribute to the problem.
A chat forum to argue the rights & wrongs of climate change, peak oil/coal/resources, nuclear power, carbon tax vs carbon trade etc. Global Effort might question if these indeed are the real problems, or the divisive dualistic thinking in response to them, or the structures of science and economics themselves, for example.
A vehicle for a particular technological, economic, political, cultural or psychological solution. Rather, Global Effort might distill the similarities-differences and highlight the short-comings of each to help build a robust, resilient path forward.
A library of information collecting digital dust while inflating intellectual egos. The intention of Global Effort is to inform decisions and visions somewhere.

Driving Questions
This site is driven to discover and create more substantial and more helpful answers to the following questions:

What are the worlds various energy futures? What are the different ways the world sees the energy crisis and what are the responses to it?
How were each of these futures arrived at and created?
What are driving these futures?
What were the tools and methods used to craft these futures? 
Ar alternative energy futures possible?
If so, what might they be?
Could they be more appealing and more effective than current futures?
How might they be arrived at?
What are the barriers to alternative energy futures? 

Qustions which will also be considered in the process of addressing the central effort will include:

What is the relationship between energy policy, strategy and futures?
What is the role of history in energy futures? Similarly, what is the role of the future in energy history?
How might a more appealing and effective energy system possibly be realized sooner? 

Altrnatively stated, the driving questions may be posed as:

What are the various current schools of thought on energy supply, distribution and usage in the future? 
How i the world and Australia responding to the energy crisis and energy challenges? What are the challenges? 
Is thee an energy crisis? What exactly is the energy crisis? Do different responses arise from different definitions and conceptualizations of the problem? Is this part of the problem?
What do the outcomes of these responses look like, in terms of the energy system, broader social systems and at a personal level?
What techniques are currently or historically used to arrive at solutions and images?
How might alternative visions and pathways be discovered or created? What techniques and processes could be used?
Are there yet other alternative propositions and images available that have not been thought of? What existing alternative energy futures do not receive much exposure?
What can nations and organisations learn from elsewhere  other times and other place  in responding to the energy crisis?

Purpose & Rationale  Why?
Purpose of Global Effort
Naturally, Global Effort is designed to be a vehicle to answer the driving questions. This plays out in many ways:

To record the developments of Adam Duus doctoral studies in global energy futures.
To welcome assistance in enhancing this effort.
To open the conversation, not only to other minds but to other voices, visions and views.
To deepen and broaden the conversation around energy futures
To simplify the conversation around energy solutions by distilling their essence. This allows for the creation of genuine alternatives.
To share these insights and nuggets of wisdom with those who can use them.
Reasons behind Global Effort
The reasons behind Global Effort is the assertion that a lot of possibility remains available in:

expanding the role and prominence of energy futures
expanding the range of alternative energy futures
expanding individual energy futures themselves
expanding the energy futures toolbox

and that the fulfilling of even some of this possibility will help resolve some issues in world energy.

Of significant interest is investigating how the energy crisis is framed and perceived by the various stakeholders. This preconception may predefine the path ahead and limit what is possible. Arguments over how best to respond to the energy crisis may differ because the problem definitions differ.

All levels of discourse, from popular media through to academia and highlights the conflict

The overall view is that energy futures thinking is quite limited emerging from a limited range of futures tools.

More detail around this will be entered into in the guts of the site as data is presented, issues investigated, futures analyside and futures methodologies critiqued.

Energy problems are universal and their consequences massive.
Current solutions are inadequate. Current thinking is largely ineffectual.
Current energy futures thinking is rather shallow: forecasts & mathematical modelling, scenario-making for strategic competitive advantage etc.
Innovative, creative thinking is needed (and not just innovative gadgets.)
Existing energy proposals dont address such factors as the competition between visions or the inner development required to effect enduring change.

About the founder

My name is Adam Duus. I am the founder of Global Effort. 

I create the idea and basic structure initially as a way to record my efforts (no pun intended) in developing doctoral studies in Futures Studies applied to energy. The structure and terminology of the site reflects the initial structure and terminology of those studies.

The moment of inspiration for Global Effort occurred while I was employed at great digital media agency in Melbourne, Australia, DTDigital. Here I researched and blogged on the NewGenCoal website  HYPERLINK "http://www.newgencoal.com.au" www.newgencoal.com.au. This was the digital communications campaign of the Australian Coal Association to promote carbon capture and storage as one technology in the suite of climate change solutions.

I already had the idea of undertaking doctoral studies in energy futures at this time (2010). I was enamoured with the expanded possibilities of Futures Studies and my background interest lay in energy. It made sense to combine the two.

My personal readings over the years introduced me to the many, many good points made by many individuals and stakeholders in the field of energy. However, it also highlighted that conflict of ideas and a battle for legitimacy of visions dominated the field. My work on NewGenCoal confirmed this.

It was working in a web agency that gave me the idea to not only create a website but to go a step further and create a web community. I began thinking I needed a place to house all the claims, data, graphs and resources that I would map and critique. 

Fortunatey, I realised three things. One, I couldnt really tackle this alone. Theres two much information. Two, I had to recognise that, as brilliant as I like to think I am at times, others could offer insights that I would never discover. This ties in with the third realisation. Attempting this endeavour alone, as a solitary source of expertise, is not only not in the spirit of the name and purpose, it reinforces the very factor which I postulate to be fundamental in energy problems  the inability and/or reluctance to embrace other points of view and ideas, and thus generate alternatives.

And so the idea of an interactive web community was struck upon. This  encourages contributions and conversation along certain information policy guidelines. It allows for my own personal contribution to be available but also enriched by the insights and perspectives of others. This way we can hopefully arrive at more effective energy policy guiding a more effective energy system built by effective energy futures and alternative thinking tools.
