- Global Energy Futures. Not financial futures.
- This research deals with global energy futures. That is, the plans, proposals, trends, images and visions of energy systems in the future that are held, created and debated around the world. This is not to be confused with the speculative trading of energy commodities in financial markets, also known as “trading energy futures.”

- Not just scenarios et al
- When considering “futures” we may consider, but not be limited to, commonly known ideas as trends, forecasting, scenarios, wild cards and outliers, expert prediction, computer modelling and many others. This research will include these well-known representations of the future, as well as introduce and embrace many others. There is an emphasis on depth, criticality, fringe data and problematising energy futures as well as energy futuring methodology, thus calling on novel analytical futures tools.
-
- An array of suggested pathways already exist...
- An array of suggested pathways and scenarios already exist for what the world’s energy system will look like in the future. Packages of steps, strategies, methods and technologies are proposed by numerous stakeholders. These various permutations are created to realize the stakeholders’ preferred vision of the world; and how and why society should  source and supply electricity and fuel, and for what purpose.
-
- Energy system visions are encased in broader images of society.
- Seeing how fundamentally energy technology and energy availability shapes life, this work on energy futures must include the broader images of future human civilization employing such systems. Furthermore, this research looks at the process and methods involved in the generation of these energy futures.
- These competing visions are the subject of clash, conflict, debate, protest, vilification, ridicule and much fear.
-
- This burgeoning of stakeholders and interest groups, and the rapidly increasing complexity and importance of debate and discussion, begs the following research questions be addressed.
- Research Questions - dissertation
- What are the world's energy futures?

	- Encapsulating and permeating all these energy dilemmas is the conflict within and between each domain. No level or sphere is left out: from international wars to dining room verbal violence. Energy and power – the capacity to release energy, is at the heart of much conflict, while conflict and struggle is impossible without it.  There is the conflict around the validity and accuracy of the above claims and data. Is climate change due anthropogenic actually occurring? If so, is it really caused by humans? And even if that is so, the degree, extent and rate is hotlly debated. Is ‘peakism’ alarmism? Examples of conflict beyond the definition of ‘debate’ might include ‘Climate-gate’ and its ensuing inquiries, responses to ‘An Inconventient Truth’, the promise of tar sands, shale gas and coal-to-liquids to alleviate oil scarcity, assurances over the safety of nuclear power, or the ability of renewables to provide baseload power. Each are denied, fiercely. Each are advocated, passionately.  Then there is conflict over the solution strategy, for whichever valid drivers and prioritised challenges. Technologies compete within a free market economic system for market share. Some may argue this is simply healthy competition of a free capitalist market, yet others may argue extensive subsidies prop up an inefficient hegemony. Energy-economic development models too vie for supremacy.  Examples of this might include public demonstrations against the Jabiluka mine in Australia, NIMBYism around nuclear facilities or wind turbines, as well as the rejection of solar power in Kenya http://www.scidev.net/en/climate-change-and-energy/most-kenyans-say-no-to-cleaner-energy-study-finds.html?utm_source=link&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=en_climatechangeandenergy or remote Guatemalan villages. Worlds, and worldviews, collide.  There is then, of course, the ultimate extensions of the foregoing conflicts - the bloodshed and hardship arising from our current energy systems.

	- Energy is life. It is essential to all systems. At a micro-level, energy is intrinsic to all systems. At a social level, all human activity is characterized by the acquisition, harnessing and use of energy. Energy is central. No one, and no thing, is neither separate from it nor free from its effects. Food, metabolism, mobility, heating and cooling, lighting, weather, materials and their working, tools and their powering, thought... All are energetic processes.   Energy in its broadest scientific sense versus its quasi-spiritual sense versus energy in its business, economic, political or “everyday” sense.  Oil is the single most traded commodity in the world. (Ref?) The global energy industry accounts for Z% of turnover (Ref?) Nations go to war over energy. Nations use energy to go to war. “Energy is the sole universal currency”(Smil, 2006).

Energy can be considered a is a meta-crisis, meta-problem. A convergence of crises. Economics Environment Peace Development  Size of energy industry Ubiquitousness/universality of energy  So, in an effort to ensure what most of us want – a peaceful, prosperous life – a future energy system which facilitates peace and prosperity is fundamental. Similarly, in choosing where to act in an effort to influence the world and society, transforming energy policy stands out as a point of extreme leverage. Energy policy stands as a cause of, and simultaneously, a solution to, humanity’s challenges. Energy policy can allow for more leisure time, improve food supply, control ambient atmosphere and comfort, illuminate places of learning, electrify technologies of healing, growth and entertainment, and enable long-distance communication and exploration of the frontiers of humanity.  Or not. Energy policy can also mobilize oppressors, destabilize atmosphere, pollute, foster illness and disease, confine wealth and power and retard social development. Which path is travelled is strongly influenced by energy policy as much as conversely energy policy is influenced by which course is chosen. The quality and quantity of energy, as determined by energy policy, is a grand factor in human social development. While energy may or may not be a driver of development, there is certainly a correlation between energy consumption and standards of living.
	- These statements summaries (statistics and comments above) highlight various significant points:
	- 1. The challenges around energy are no longer local (or even regional), short-term nor confined to techno-economics. Energy problems are now openly global, long-term, deeply embedded within society, multi-faceted, trans-disciplinary and potentially catastrophic or revolutionary.  2. A wide spectrum of world and life-views, opinions, priorities and values are represented within energy policies and strategies. Competing energy visions and solution pathways battle for supremacy consuming much human, financial, material, environmental and time resource in the conflict.  3. New approaches in formulating energy policy are warranted. Traditional scientific, economic and political approaches have provided much historically but have also brought overseen the emergence of on the challenges we face. Strong environmental approaches may beare very well intentioned, and have also achieved much, but do not seem to be very effective eitherstill less than desired lacking penetration as well..  4. Our energy systems and policies are tied to our identities and relationships. Transforming energy policy goes hand-in-hand with transforming personal, social and civilizational structures and identity.identity.  It is proposed that no existing energy futures satisfactorily address the complexity of the energy crisis or represent the richness of stakeholders. This is, in part because no adequate energy futuring toolbox exists to facilitate this. By taking a critical futures approach and employing deep, participatory, transformative futures methodologies, this work aims to make a contribution in addressing this.  The world in which Australia sits is in conflict and much of this is tied to energy. Uncertainty and fears grows in the present changing climate (atmospheric, financial and political). To alleviate suffering and promote prosperity, now and in the future, and to address the myriad, complex problems around energy, alternative energy futures must be created which capture the hearts and minds of more and more people. These futures must be broader, go deeper and be more inclusive than any existing Australian energy futures presently are.
	- Rather than feeling at the mercy of external factors and poorly understood forces, Australia can choose its preferred energy future(s) and take action to realize it. This research will look at what could be done, what could be changed and how so for Australia to actively lead itself into an energy future it wants rather than be dragged into an energy future it doesn’t.

- Why a Futures approach?
- Why a Futures approach?  (as opposed to modelling, forecasting etc.)
-
- This research is undertaken through the field of Futures Studies for a number of reasons:
- Complexity.
- Complexity. As stated earlier, energy is a universal, fundamental, complex issue replete with multi-dimensional interactions and feedback loops between diverse elements and with much historical weight. Futures Studies is multi-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary by nature and is potentially well-geared to addressing complexities of energy.
- Policy.
- Policy. Futures Studies provides a broad suite of tools to augment policy. It offers methodologies to improve the policy creation process as well as open up policy options to include previously unconsidered or unimagined possibilities. Futures Studies offers methods to return agency to individuals and groups in creating preferred futures rather than merely reluctantly receiving others’ unwanted probable used futures.
- Why deep, transformative, participatory futures studies?
- Why deep, transformative, participatory futures studies?   Futures Studies (FS) as a discipline, theory and set of methodologies is dealt with in more detail in section 1.5, Theory and Methodology. For the moment though, suffice to say that FS is the use of the concept of the future to assess, guide and interpret the present. Various schools of thought exist in FS, as will be outlined in greater detail in section 1.5. A deep, participatory, transformative futures approch is adopted here for the following reasons: This research is undertaken through the field of Futures Studies for a number of reasons:  1. Personal interest to the author.  2. Novelty.  A cursory survey of literature reveals energy futures are already routinely addressed via conventional economic, mathematic, engineering, geologic, ecologic and similar techno-economic and system science approaches. To the best of the author’s knowledge, there remains the need to adequately complement and contextualise these useful techniques with approaches beyond reductionist narrow hard science methods and mindsets, or shallow system science perspectives. FS offers tools that can place appropriate value on sophisticated orthodox techniques by recognizing their time and place of usefulness, while simultaneously enriching the discourse.  3. Ability to encompass complexity, depth and breadth of perspective. As stated earlier, energy is a universal, fundamental, complex issue. It is replete with multi-dimensional interactions, layers of meaning and perspective, and feedback loops between diverse physical and social elements, and carrieswith much historical and cultural weight. Futures Studies A deep, participatory futures approach is multi-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary by nature, acknowleding the wealth of stakeholders, the deep foundations of their views and is potentially well-geared to addressing complexities of energysuch complexity.   4. Policy influence. Futures StudiesFS provides a broad suite of tools to augment policy. In fact, futures underlie policy, whether a particular policy-maker agrees with it or not. [ref] It offers methodologies to improve the policy creation process as well as open up policy options to include previously unconsidered or unimagined possibilities. Futures StudiesFS offers methods to return agency to individuals and groups in creating preferred futures rather than merely unconsciously or reluctantly receiving others’ unwanted probable used futures.  5. Pragmatic utility. Much of the energy discourse focuses on the likelihood and implications of future events such as the forecast impacts of climate change or the timing of peak resource production. It thus seems the logical choice to use the methodologies of the study of the future to examine these predictions and forecasts. These tools may help to prepare for and alleviate any “future shock” – social and individual paralysis – arising out of an unexpected or unimagined future. Furthermore, futures tools provide means to proactively create a preferred future rather than feel helpless in the face of an imposed probable future. FS has potential to facilitate “transition midwifery” as the future unfolds and certain aspects of energy systems die while others gain ascendency.  6. Unifying capability. The fields and scope of inquiry available via FS is vast, sweeping the broad horizons of time and subject, plunging from surface inquiry to deep philosophical premises. While FS doesn’t offer the final answer, its domain of investigation enables multiple perspectives, approaches and worldviews to be situated together under one roof. In doing so, connections between them are now possible; common ground can be identified and reinforced while differences too can be seen and perspectivized.  FS not only allows for shades of grey but a merging of a spectrum of hues of varying intensities viewed at different resolutions.  7. Recontextualisation of technology. In an age where science and technology are highly prized, energy challenges can be seen purely as problems of physical and economic science, to which innovative technologies and market instruments are the solution. FS seeks not to devalue the role of technology in society but can increase its value by identifying the degree the techno-centric view contributes to shaping the problem. Understandings of the philosophical foundations of this view, available via deep, critical futures, can improve the effectiveness of technology as part of a preferred energy system.  8. Stakeholder empowerment and reclaiming of agency. The energy industry is behemoth with many stakeholders feeling isolated from decision-making. The forces of large energetic systems, such as the world’s climate or economy, can seem threatening and overwhelming, leading to disillusionment and despair. Focusing on seemingly invariant structures and probable forecasts in energy systems can erode personal and organisational power. Over-concentration on scenarios created by others limits possibility. Deep, participatory, transformative futures can help stakeholders reclaim and remember their power to mould their future rather than merely respond.  Redefining problem construction. Deep, participatory, transformative futures represent and contain a type of self-reflexive analysis which offer insights rarely available using traditional analytical methods. While it is postulated that deep participatory, transformative futures work will be beneficial in addressing energy problems, it is also posited that the absence of such investigative methods is an intrinsic part of the problem itself. In failing to examine fully all aspects of a stakeholders’ energy future, not only are problems produced and effectiveness reduced, it constitutes part of the very problem. Deep, participatory, transformative futures offer tools to allay this by complementing traditional, conventional techniques.   Deep, participatory, transformative futures vs shallow, predictive-empirical futures

	- Now, more than ever, energy systems which promote life, peace and prosperity are urgently needed. The transition(s) to a better energy system must be rapid to avoid potential catastrophe such as climate change and reduce potential unnecessary suffering. The transition(s) must be smooth to minimize social disruptions from such things as finite oil supply and environmental degradation. The transition(s) must promote peace so as not to fertilize conflict already surrounding resource security.

- Limits of Research
- 1.6 Limits of Research  To guide the reader, as well as to clearly distinguish this work from any mistaken idea of lumping it with the plethora of energy “futures” works pieces already available, this section succintly presents the essence of the research. Here is summarised what this research is about, what its not about, what it does and doesn’t cover, and what it will, and will not, do.
- Not the stockmarket, speculation or trading.
- 1.6.1 Not the stockmarket, speculation or trading.  It is interesting to note howThis work has nothing directly to do with the speculation of energy commodity prices on the “futures” market. It is concerned with the traditional sense of the word “future” as “a time yet to come”, which carries with it expectations, aspirations, fears, historical inertia, wildcard and outlier events (both foreseen and unforeseeable), cyclic phenomena and the unconscious becoming conscious.   Using critical and transformative futures theory and methodologies applied to gross energy supply, distribution and usage, the over-arching aim is to create more inspiring and more robust energy futures, with a goal being to assist the healing of conflict within the energy domain.
- Distinct from climate change policy and response.
- 1.6.2 Distinct from climate change policy and response.   Why “energy” and not “climate change”?  The research focuses on “energy” rather than “climate change”. This is for a number of reasons.  From an initial literature survey, it is the author’s opinion that climate change driven energy research dominates energy discourse. Understandably, climate change presents a grand challenge with far-reaching consequences. However, it is not the sole driver of energy futures. This research intends to explicate that. In fact, it is hypothesized that climate change alone may not be a sufficient or effective driver of energy futures to ultimately address climate change. An inappropriately heavy focus on climate change is a driver of energy futures may indeed limit the efficacy or appeal of energy futures.  The purpose of taking a critical futures approach to the topic of energy is to “open up” the future, rather than reinforce hegemonic views. As a counter-balance, one would hope to see the futures of climate change (as opposed to the geophysical futures of the climate) thoroughly investigated as well, though this will be beyond the scope of this study.  At one level,  primarily because anthropogenic climate change is seen in this research, at one level, as a symptom of an energy problem, and not the underlying problem itself. From the point of view of this research, “responding to climate change” highlights the cause-effect confusion hypothesized in Section 1.2.2.1 rather than responding to the socio-economic energy systems which produced it. By focusing on climate change, other lesser publicized symptoms of the modern industrial energy system may be neglected. Furthermore, The issue of climate change is not completely a subset of energy but there is a strong overlap in favour of energy being the broader issue of concern. aAny response  to climactic changes through mitigation and adaptation will require a change in energy policy, as well as energy to implement changes, responses and solutions.   According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ref?), the leading causes of human induced climate change are results of modern stationary energy generation, transport, agriculture and deforestation practices. While the first two in the list are obvious, agriculture and forestry serve as significant sources of energy, significant users of energy and significant sources and sinks of greenhouse gas emissions. The “food or fuel” debate looms as a crisis point inn an Australian biofuelenergy futures, as do “food miles” and a secure fuel supply for food supply. A result of this research may be to directly include the likes of agriculture and biomass management within the realms of energy policy to capture the full picture of the energy system and thus create better alternative energy futures.  It is also the author’s initial opinion that climate change driven energy research dominates energy discourse. Understandably, it presents a grand challenge with far-reaching consequences. However, it is hypothesized that climate change alone may not be a sufficient driver of strategy to ultimately address climate change. Furthermore, by focusing on climate change, other lesser publicized symptoms of the modern industrial energy system may be neglected. Climate change may be a symptom of modern energy policy and it may be one of many symptoms.  No doubt climate change sits as one of, if not, the major drivers of global and Australian energy futures. However, it is a sub-question of this research whether it sits as an effective driver of energy futures and policy. By taking an open energy futures focus, its theorized that alternative futures open up to include broader possibilities than if climate change were the sole driver. An open energy futures approach would seek address climate change as well as other energy issues, such as poverty and development, peak oil and a carbon based economy, terrorism and nuclear risks. An “energy futures” driven approach with biospheric integrity as a weighty element serves to complement the climate change driven research, enhancing the chances for social and economic prosperity, as well as environmental.
- Not prediction or forecasting.
- 1.6.3 Not prediction or forecasting.  Forecasts have been, and will likely continue to be, one of the two dominant futuring efforts in energy and resources. There is no shortage of forecasts and predictions and therefore no need for this research to add to the list, except where the nature of the forecast or prediction may be distinctly novel. It is argued that forecasting is over-emphasised to the detriment of itself energy futures and the method itself, devaluing its very own worth. While energy forecasts can have a useful planning and provocative role, they are also typically inaccurate and unstable. [Ref & Citations]  Excessive reliance on forecasting also devalues the role of agency, resigning our lot to uncontrollable external factors and “hidden hands”. The view is we merely need to know what has already been determined to happen in the future and situate our organiszation most strategically.   Distinct from “foresight” which carries more of a capacity-building connotation, forecasting narrows and closes the future, which is often neither accurate or empowering [use quotes here on limitations of forecasting]. Forecasting undoubtedly does have its value, particularly in its identification of negative business-as-usual trends. The argument here is that it is over-valued and over-exercised.  Rather, this research will look at athe wider spectrum of methods used in energy futuring, encouraging the increased use of those which open up the future and create space for the generation of authentic, empowering alternaives.
- Suggestive, not prescriptive.
- 1.6.4 Suggestive, not prescriptive.  This research ultimately aims to offerOffering alternatives rather than answersprescribe pathways. The literature is replete with “solutions” for a sustainable, secure, clean, green, prosperous, cheap, limitless, safe, [insert adjective here] energy future. The language is strong and the arguments are unequivocal, often carrying a sense of intellectual superiority and finality. “My way is the best because…”   This research argues that this very prescriptive approach constitutes part of the problem – the poor ability to compromise, contextualize and co-operate. Rather, this work adopts the idea that a) everyone has, and is, part of the answer;, and b) no one has all of the answer;, and c) the answer, or part thereof, is best generated from within, not provided from without.   Prescription
- Less concerned with content detail. More concerned with trends, deep patterns, underlying myth and p
- 1.6.5 Less concerned with content detail. More concerned with trends, deep patterns, underlying myth and process. The details of energy futures, and their surface critique, constitute the feedstock of this work. They are readily available to the reader via the bibliography and there is no need to repeat them.   The aim of this work is to introduce depth and breadth to what might be considered a narrow and shallow discourse. This work will attend to the detail of energy futures to the degree required to ascertain the essential, underlying structures and features, as well as the goals for which they are created. These may differ from the descriptions given by stakeholders themselves.  Alternatively, detail may be focused upon where the energy future expressed is novel or little known. This work hopes to introduce an energy future that is novel in content to every reader in the effort to present a wider range of genuine alternatives.
- Process determines content
- 1.6.6 Process determines content With an understanding that the results (content) of investigation and analysis are, to a large degree, determined by the tools used and the procedure followed, this study prioritises examination of the methods employed in creating energy futures, and their inherent assumptions. This is where a focus on detail is more likely to be apparent. “Pay attention to the process, and the results will take care of themselves”, is the adage that is relevant here.
- Not questioning validity of drivers.
- 1.6.7 Not questioning validity of drivers.
- Minimise moralising
- 1.6.8 Minimise moralising In this work it is the intention to minimize moralising, steer clear of debate over whether climate change due to anthropogenic global warming is real or not; or whether peak oil is a valid phenomenon or not.
- Will not repeat what is done at length elsewhere in the mainstream energy debate..
- 1.6.9 Will not repeat what is done at length elsewhere in the mainstream energy debate..  The purpose of this work is to recontextualise, reperspectivise and reframe the energy debate, not repeat and rehash what has gone before.   The intention is to respect all futures, not to question the validity of. However, it is the intention to question their effectiveness in realising their purported objectives.  In particular, it will not enter into   In particular, climate change debate, technology validity debate, financial mechanisms debate etc. It will instead attempt to look at what underlies each of the positions on these energy-related issues.

- About Global Effort
- Overview of Global Effort
- Welcome to Global Effort.
- Global Effort is a platform for exploring Global Energy Futures, Foresight and Transitions.
- To elaborate slightly on the obvious, it operates at the intersection of:
- Energy - fossil fuels, renewables, nuclear, as well as exploring some unconventional technologies
- Futures - scenarios, forecasts, models, roadmaps, pathways, visions etc. (ie. not ‘futures’ as in speculative commodity prices)
- Foresight - processes, tools, techniques and methods to develop and construct futures
- Socio-technical transitions - socio-economic shifts in predominant technological systems
-
- ROLES & PURPOSE
- It is hoped that Global Effort will evolve over time to fill multiple roles and serve many purposes. This progression is only broadly linear with multiple phases being undertaken concurrently.
- 1. A platform for documenting the learnings and developments in the PhD studies of Adam Duus.
- 2. A repository of data relevant to the topics.
- 3. An atlas of energy futures maps.
- 4. A community of energy futurists, practitioners and laypeople.
- 5. A consultancy and think-tank.
-
- AIMS & OBJECTIVES
- The broad aims and objectives are to address some driving questions which should hopefully manifest in a sequence of overlapping cycles.
- 1. To survey the manifold, disparate energy futures instances (tooltip: the particular propositions put forward for energy futures, as well as their creators, supporters).
- 2. To map (locate in knowledge space) energy futures.
- 3. To critically analyse and deconstruct these energy futures.
- 4. To expand and deepen the discourse around energy futures.
- 5. Work with stakeholders to make their energy future more robust and useful.
- Read more about the objectives and purpose.
-
- Global Effort also means what it says, literally: to undertake any transition towards a more beneficial energy system will require a global effort; not only global in geography and global in scope. That is to say contributions will be needed from, and for, all parts of the world, all sectors of society, all disciplines of scholarship, all levels of reality, all aspects of self, all moments of the time-line. While I may have a preferred energy future, Global Efforts initial objective is to acknowledge the positions and preferences of each existing energy future.
-
-
- Welcome to Global Effort
- Global Effort is a platform for exploring Global Energy Futures, Foresight and Transitions. It sets out to evolve into greater capacities over time, though not necessarily in a strictly linear flow.
- Stage 1
- 1. A platform for documenting the learnings and developments in the PhD studies of Adam Duus. Very early stages of PhD studies at the University of the Sunshine Coast, in Australia. Prospectively titled “Mapping and Questioning Global Energy Futures.” Supervisor(s) to be confirmed. This requires much reading and writing, obviously. The platform of a blog (theoretically) encourages regular writing, structure within/between the writing, invites commentary and feedback, and establishes an on-line presence. Thoughts, ideas, article summaries, interesting learnings and discoveries, book reviews, meta-reflections, an aggregator of news feeds and social media…, all for primarily my own purposes, would be most of the elements at this stage of the platform.
- 2. A repository of data relevant to the topics. The grist for the PhD mill, all stored in one convenient location. The extra effort of placing it online forces further engagement with the content, and hopefully deeper learning. The data might include macroscopic data on energy supply & demand, a growing catalog of energy futures instances, key thinkers, influencers and organisations, summaries of publications, frameworks and typologies, energy-related theories and more.
- 3. An introduction to the field of Futures Studies. While people have been thinking about tomorrow since time began, it has only emerged as an academic discipline and formal set of tools in the last 50~60 years. As a set of theories and tools it holds great power beyond mere academia and a basic appreciation can be leveraged for great personal benefit in any field. Global Effort applies theoretical frameworks and methodologies from Futures Studies to energy systems around the world, so it makes sense to have a primer/catalog.
- Stage 2
- As a result of the preceding work, Global Effort hopes to develop further.
- 4. An atlas of energy futures maps and a catalog of debate/argument visualisations. Not maps in terms of geography, geology or weather (as is naturally common when talking about energy resources) but rather locating futures instances (ideas, proposals, visions) and perhaps their elements (actors, technologies, policy mechanisms) along myriad dimensions and axes of the energy futures landscape. As a conventional map uses dimensions such as latitude/longitude, elevation and isobars and such features as colour coding for, say, aridity or population density, the same or similar can be done for futures. Futures instances can be situated along axes determined by using a particular theoretical framework. These futures instances can occupy multiple frameworks, and occupy a different spatial location in that. Global Effort seeks to explore further this intersection of Futures Mapping and Knowledge Cartography for the case of energy futures, to produce a panorama for navigation into the future.
- 5. A community of like-minded energy futurists, practitioners and laypeople interested in learning more, sharing insights and developing ideas and practices. While Global Effort is starting out as a one-man endeavour, its goal is not to remain that way. Its aim is to invite and encourage contributions (with due acknowledgement) from other interested parties, whether that be in the form of opinion pieces, debates (which shall be summarised visually for easy digestion)
- 5. A consultancy and think-tank of experts and professionals engaging with the community at large through publications, workshops, lectures and debates. The goal is not to remain theoretical and/or isolated, locked in the ivory tower. That is the easy part. The real challenge comes from building bridges, deconstructing walls, digging for ore and generating energy with, within and between stakeholders. It involves taking energy futures out of hard sciences and mechanistic interaction and introducing soft skills and a human dimension.

- Limits: What GE is NOT
- We can further explain what GE is, or attempts to be, by contrasting it with what it is not, or attempts not to be.
- Global Effort is NOT:
- 1. A prescription for our energy future. It does not attempt to say this is what we should or must do. No ‘my way or the highway.’ Instead, Global Effort is more like a street directory: what are the possible pathways to get from energy present to energy future X. It collates all the prescriptions and suggestions that others have made, and looks more closely at them using lenses that they themselves most likely did not use. It is hypothesised that this analysis may improve each energy future in some way, and possibly even generate a set of alternative pathways for consideration.
- 2. A wiki of techno-economic energy ‘solutions’. Neither is Global Effort a wiki containing isolated articles about technologies or economic instruments which could or should be used to remedy or rectify the energy ‘crisis’ as defined by the proponent. What ‘solutions’ are proposed depends on what the ‘problem’ is. Global Effort will survey definitions of the energy crisis and their subsequently suggested solutions.
- Rather, an aim of Global Effort is to analyse particular energy futures using various approaches and situate them in the larger energy futures discourse. Rather than just record what is out there, Global Effort shall classify, group, compare-contrast, distill and map, such that genuinely alternative futures are identified.
- Wikis tend to be quite ‘flat’ in their knowledge structure. Yes, they may go into detail but not so much depth in terms of a critical philosophical framework. Conventional wiki informational nodes are connected in a flatland horizontal structure via simple hypertext links. Global Effort attempts to situate the same energy futures information within hierarchical and 3-dimensional (or more) knowledge frameworks via ‘vertical’ relational linking. This way, energy futures can be more critically investigated for such things as underlying assumptions and premises and over-arching ambitions. Traditionally, wiki info is presented in isolation, out of context. Global Effort, in contrast, situates this information in context, in the bigger narrative that is being told, explicitly or implicitly.
- 3. Technologically or economically focused. Most proposals centre around debates over technology choices and economic policy instruments. These are no doubt fundamentally important, however Global Effort takes the view that perhaps an over-emphasis on this approach is part of the very problem they are trying to solve. There are a wider and deeper array of factors to consider, and their denial may perpetuate or, at best, merely postpone problems.
- 4. A first-order data source. Similar to the above, Global Effort does not intend to store data just to be a database. Much excellent work is already done on such things as energy supply and demand, climate forecasts, energy poverty etc. There is no need to have yet another blog presenting these. Instead, Global Effort will pull data from these authoritative, reliable sources to compare and contrast competing visions and claims. It will present data to support or contest identified energy futures and their arguments. Naturally, all data sources are referenced.
- 5. A soapbox for rants, sophisticated or not-so-subtle, for or against a particular ‘conventional’ position on energy. It is not a community to gather for or against climate ‘alarmists’, climate ‘deniers’, peak oil ‘debunkers’, peak oil ‘fearmongerers’, renewables ‘dreamers’, fossil fuel ‘cavemen’… All these futures positions will be under the microscope. Global Effort does not purport to be unbiased or impartial - positions will be taken and stances stated. However, it will most likely be along lines that are novel and unconventional, as a result of research and analysis.
- Global Effort is unique in some ways, contrasting with some similar projects.
-
- Topics and Features
- Obviously the overall subject of Global Effort is global energy futures. That is, what does the future look like for the world’s energy systems, and what do we want it to look like. In doing so we’ll deal with a variety of topics, some of which are expected, others not so obvious.

- Driving Questions
- An Overview of Driving Questions
- Global Effort derives out of some central questions which trigger some further, downstream questions. It centres around energy, of course, but also serves as an introduction and primer for Futures Studies.
- What are the world’s energy futures? That is, what do the world’s energy systems look like in the future? What are stakeholders proposing, envisioning, forecasting, openly or secretly fearful of? What energy futures dominate the discourse? What are fringe? What are probable, plausible and possible energy futures?
- What are the world’s futures given these energy systems? Energy is so integral and universal that we cannot separate the energy system from social structures powered by it.
- Why might we want alternative energy futures? That is, alternative “energy futures” as well as “alternative energy” futures. What are the drivers, the rationales, the agendas? Our objectives can determine our means.
- How are these particular energy futures arrived at? What tools, theories and frameworks are applied? What approaches are over-used, improperly used, neglected? What is their record of success, accuracy or helpfulness?
- Can alternative energy futures be generated? What knowledge cartographies exist to map the current discourse and therefore identify new terrains, short cuts, “edges of the world”? Will use of certain analytical approaches identify deeper similarities and differences, thus making novelty possible? How are energy futures currently categorised? Are there typologies and taxonomies of (energy) futures which can assist in understanding? Are there outliers and wild cards which no one is really talking about…yet?
- Global Effort explores the futures of energy but also uses energy to explore the field of futures and foresight. Therefore general questions around futures are also investigated, such as:
- What is the difference between futures, strategy and policy? How do they inter-relate?
- What are deep, critical, transformative futures, as opposed to shallow, predictive futures?
- What futures methodologies exits? What are traditional and common? What are novel and innovative?
-
- These are the tip of the iceberg. As with any investigative endeavour, new questions are generated as answers are discovered.
-
-
- Purpose, Roles & Rationale
-
-
- It is hoped that Global Effort will evolve over time to fill multiple roles and serve many purposes. This progression is only broadly linear with multiple phases in parallel, developed to different stage.
- 1. A platform for documenting the learnings and developments in the PhD studies of Adam Duus. Thoughts, ideas, article summaries, interesting learnings and discoveries, book reviews, meta-reflections. The purpose and rationale of Adam’s PhD research is discussed in more detail here.
- 2. A repository of data relevant to the topics. This would include macroscopic data on energy supply & demand etc but also a catalog of energy futures instances, key thinkers, influencers and organisations, summaries of publications, frameworks and typologies, energy-related theories and more.
- 3. An atlas of energy futures maps; not maps in terms of geography but rather locating futures instances and actors along myriad dimensions and axes of the energy futures landscape. The dimensions of these maps and the “co-ordinates” of the energy futures instances will begin to emerge out of our research.
- 4. A community of like-minded energy futurists, practitioners and laypeople interested in learning more, sharing insights and developing ideas and practices.
- 5. A consultancy and think-tank of experts and professionals engaging with the community at large through publications, workshops, lectures and debates.

- Purpose and Rationale of PhD Research
- The purpose of my (Adam’s) PhD research is to set out to answer the central driving questions. Summarised again here, they are:
- What are the world’s energy futures?
- Are they really different? If so, how so?
- How are these energy futures created?
- Are alternative energy futures possible? Can novel analytical tools and theoretical frameworks be used to generate and incorporate genuine alternatives?
- Furthermore, my research intends to introduce approaches not only from Futures Studies but Knowledge Cartography to map, cognitively and visually, the energy futures landscape. Just as geographical features are mapped for navigation, and geological strata is mapped for resource identification, the energy futures landscape warrants mapping to navigate the dangerous shoals and locate the high-yield ore.
- Just like any PhD research, its rationale is tied to its innovation and novelty.
- A plethora of energy futures exist giving an impression of an abundance of choice. However, nowhere (to my knowledge) have these futures been a) collated to get an accurate figure or representation of the number or proposals, and the stakeholders behind them and b) classified into schema which actually identifies the real options available and who is promoting their adoption, and why.
- There exists no work, to my knowledge, which applies critical futures studies tools such as Causal Layered Analysis to deepen the analysis of these energy futures to illuminate underlying features. It is hypothesised that what may appear distinct on the surface is rather similar and repetitive when the underbelly is exposed.
- The importance of all this arises from the significant modern consequences of our energy systems. Climate change, peak oil, energy poverty, nuclear contamination, energy “sieging” (think Russia’s control of European gas sources), oil-derived conflict, nuclear weapons programs, environmental pollution and resource-based terrorism; the litany of potentially grave social, economic and environmental consequences of energy system design and use is long and recalcitrant.
- Energy futures are critical in and of themselves, being a traditional, universal need in the form of food, labour and transport as well as more recent services such as communication, lighting, heating-cooling and so on. However, furthermore, energy futures represent our source of peace and prosperity, security or scarcity as energy drives our biophysical ecosystems and socio-economic engines. The question is to what are we driven? Where do we drive ourselves? Environmental collapse? Social conflict? Self-destruction? Or genuine prosperity, security and peace? Energy is central to all this. Energy futures symbolise our future dreams in present plans and preparations.
- Aims, Objectives, Expected Outcomes
- The broad aims and objectives are to address some driving questions which should hopefully manifest in a sequence of overlapping cycles.
- Aims as an intellectual research exercise
- 1. To survey the manifold, disparate energy futures instances (tooltip: the particular propositions put forward for energy futures, as well as their creators, supporters). This also includes energy future techniques and practices ie. how energy futures are constructed. Who is proposing what, how are they arriving at their preferred pathways and plausible visions, and why?
- 2. To classify and group these myriad energy futures. To make the energy futures discourse more manageable by simplification into types and categories yet maintain the required distinctions. When we boil it down what can we really choose from at the moment?
- 3. To critically analyse and deconstruct these energy futures. Apply some novel analytical frameworks to uncover elements within the energy future instance which are assumed, opaque and unarticulated. What are these energy futures implying without saying it, what are the meaning without signifying it?
- 4. To map energy futures. That is, using a variety of theoretical frameworks and non-geospatial axes, situate these energy futures in knowledge space. How do energy futures (individual instances as well as types) compare to others and relate to each other? What dimensions of analysis could be used?
- 5. To expand the discourse and spectrum of discussion and debate around energy futures. Introduce and encourage levels of depth and disregarded alternatives. What discussion is avoided? What is repeated ad-nauseum with no breakthrough? What proposals are ignored, ridiculed or even suppressed? What lies at or beyond the limits of the maps?
- 6. Work with stakeholders to make their energy future more robust and useful. What additions, deletions or modifications could help stakeholders’ preferred energy futures become more widely or more quickly adopted? Upon reflection, do stakeholders still want their previously preferred futures?
- 7. To generate novel, genuinely alternative energy futures. This requires rigorously identifying and analysing what exists already. Is something genuinely novel possible? Would it be worthwhile? Attractive? How might this be done?
- As of Global Effort as a platform
- Web platform
- Global Effort hopes to incorporate web technologies to communicate its discoveries and ideas. This may include
- Searchable catalogue of energy futures instances and types with their properties and attributes.
- Argument maps and debate graphs of energy-related issues and futures thinking.
- Collaborative knowledge generation and dissemination.
- Visualization of energy futures. Graphically locating energy futures in geometrical space, as well as non-verbally representing energy futures.
- Community building around deep energy futures. High-quality moderated discussion forum for novel analyses of energy futures topics unavailable elsewhere. Cultivating energy literacy, futures literacy and reflective practice is the goal here.
-
- Social and business platform
- More broadly, Global Effort sees itself as an advocate rather than an overt activist. Its not designed to advocate for a particular energy future, even though contributors may hold personal preferences and visions. Rather, its aimed at facilitating energy futures that work for more in the face of some substantial inertia and forceful counter-weights. Our research and ideas may be used by activists from any side, but does not imply that we necessarily support their position, goals or methods.
- As a burgeoning business entity, Global Effort consults with organisations that seek to make change and exert influence in energy futures directions, both externally and internal to the organisation. Confronting blind spots, easing internal resistance, increasing internal buy-in, navigating paradigm shift, mapping capacity development will be features of our work along with trend analysis, scenario development and future-proofing.

- Not just forecasts and scenarios
- When considering “futures” we may consider, but not be limited to, commonly known ideas as trends, forecasting, scenarios, wild cards and outliers, expert prediction, computer modelling and many others. This research will include these well-known representations of the future, as well as introduce and embrace many others. There is an emphasis on depth, criticality, fringe data and problematising energy futures as well as energy futuring methodology, thus calling on novel analytical futures tools.
-
- An array of suggested pathways already exist
- An array of suggested pathways and scenarios already exist for what the world’s energy system will look like in the future. Packages of steps, strategies, methods and technologies are proposed by numerous stakeholders. These various permutations are created to realize the stakeholders’ preferred vision of the world; and how and why society should  source and supply electricity and fuel, and for what purpose.

- Competing visions
- These competing visions are the subject of clash, conflict, debate, protest, vilification, ridicule and much fear. They are the objects of huge investment, financial, energetic and otherwise. They are also the idols of much hope and and promise.
- Energy system visions are encased in broader images of society.
- Energy system visions are encased in broader images of society.

- Where could they go? What could they be? What could they incorporate, include, embody?
-
- An array of approaches to energy futures also already exists.
- Research Questions - dissertation
- This burgeoning of stakeholders and interest groups, and the rapidly increasing complexity and importance of debate and discussion, begs the following research questions be addressed.
- What are the world's energy futures?
- Is this more accurately stated as "What are the world's main, well-known energy futures?" ? Or does it include all?
- What are the different ways the world views and values energy issues, the "energy crisis" and energy progress?
- What are the world's responses to these challenges?
- What is the structure of these energy futures?
- What components do they consist of?
- What are the barriers to each non-dominant future being realised?
- What is stopping them from becoming dominant? Resistance? Represession?
- What is the broader societal and civilizational future that each energy future serves, implies, assumes, favours, fosters...?
- How do energy futures relate to economic, political, environmental, social, legal et al futures?
- What is the worldview and model of the life-universe that each energy future implies?
- Where does energy ultimately come from? What is it for?
- What is the role and concept that each future ascribes to energy?
- Macroscopic flow analysis of energy.
- What differentiates each energy future?
- Are they genuinely different? If so, how different, and how are they different?
- Are taxonomies, typologies, ontologies and cartographies of energy futures possible?
- How comprehensive and rigorous are these energy futures?
- How does each future frame technology, its role, its importance, its development, its innovation, its purpose?
- That is, are intangible tools consider "technology"? Inter-personal, mental, futures, psycho-emotional, spiritual etc.
- What is the history of the world's energy futures?

- Crossroads of Crises
- At a micro-level, energy is intrinsic to all systems. At a social level, all human activity is characterised by the harnessing, exchange and use of energy. Energy is central. No one, and no thing, is neither separate from it nor free from its effects. Agriculture, metabolism, mobility, heating and cooling, lighting, weather, materials and their working, tools and their powering, thought... All are energetic processes.

- It therefore may not be a surprise to learn, then, that at the gross, global level, oil is the single most traded commodity in the world. (Ref?) Petroleum companies comprise 5 of the 10 biggest companies in the world. (ref?) The global energy industry accounts for Z% of turnover (Ref?) Nations go to war over energy. Nations use energy to go to war. “Energy is the sole universal currency”(Smil, 2006). According to some historians, the rise and fall of civilization, the shifts and movements of political, economic and technological power, can all be said to be about the successful control of energy. (Ref?) Evolution is the process of managing more complex increased energy throughputs (Ref?) Economics can be seen as the energetic exchange of energy control (Ref?)
-
- Given the ubiquity of energy, the problems of energy could be considered a potential meta-crisis. Our energy systems touch on, symbolise, incorporate, cause, and are caused by, a spectrum of inter-related issues. The occurrence of a single pathological issue calls for remedy. The convergence of all of them shouts for transformation and healing. Energy futures may present itself as one lens through which to observe all these issues in an integrated fashion, and one tool through which to simultaneously touch them all.

- Energy and power – the capacity to release energy, is at the heart of much conflict, while conflict and struggle is impossible without it.
-
- There is the conflict around the validity and accuracy of the above claims and data. Is climate change due anthropogenic actually occurring? If so, is it really caused by humans? And even if that is so, the degree, extent and rate is hotly debated. Is ‘peakism’ alarmism? Examples of conflict beyond the definition of ‘debate’ might include ‘Climate-gate’ and its ensuing inquiries, responses to ‘An Inconventient Truth’, the promise of tar sands, shale gas and coal-to-liquids to alleviate oil scarcity, assurances over the safety of nuclear power, or the ability of renewables to provide baseload power. Each are denied, fiercely. Each are advocated, passionately.
-
- Then there is conflict over the solution strategy, for whichever valid drivers and prioritised challenges. Technologies compete within a free market economic system for market share. Some may argue this is simply healthy competition of a free capitalist market, yet others may argue extensive subsidies prop up an inefficient hegemony. Energy-economic development models too vie for supremacy.  Examples of this might include public demonstrations against the Jabiluka mine in Australia, NIMBYism around nuclear facilities or wind turbines, as well as the rejection of solar power in Kenya http://www.scidev.net/en/climate-change-and-energy/most-kenyans-say-no-to-cleaner-energy-study-finds.html?utm_source=link&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=en_climatechangeandenergy or remote Guatemalan villages.

-
- So, in an effort to ensure what most of us want – a peaceful, prosperous life – a future energy system which facilitates peace and prosperity is fundamental. Similarly, in choosing where to act in an effort to influence the world and society, transforming energy policy stands out as a point of extreme leverage. Energy policy stands as a cause of, and simultaneously, a solution to, humanity’s challenges. Energy policy can allow for more leisure time, improve food supply, control ambient atmosphere and comfort, illuminate places of learning, electrify technologies of healing, growth and entertainment, and enable long-distance communication and exploration of the frontiers of humanity.  Or not.
-
- Energy policy can also mobilize oppressors, destabilize atmosphere, pollute, foster illness and disease, confine wealth and power and retard social development. Which path is travelled is strongly influenced by energy policy as much as conversely energy policy is influenced by which course is chosen.
-
- The quality and quantity of energy, as determined by energy policy, is a grand factor in human social development. While energy may or may not be a driver of development, there is certainly a correlation between energy consumption and standards of living.[ref, stats, diagram]
-
- Uncertainty and fears grows in the present changing climate (atmospheric, financial and political). To alleviate suffering and promote prosperity, now and in the future, and to address the myriad, complex problems around energy, alternative energy futures must be created which capture the hearts and minds of more and more people. These futures must be broader, go deeper and be more inclusive than any existing energy futures presently are.

Transforming energy policy goes hand-in-hand with transforming personal, social and civilizational structures and identity.  It is proposed that no existing energy futures satisfactorily address the complexity of the energy crisis or represent the richness of stakeholders. This is, in part because no adequate energy futuring toolbox exists to facilitate this. By taking a critical futures approach and employing deep, participatory, transformative futures methodologies, this work aims to make a contribution in addressing this.

- Why energy? -1
- Energy is life. It is essential to all systems. At a micro-level, energy is intrinsic to all systems. At a social level, all human activity is characterized by the acquisition, harnessing and use of energy. Energy is central. No one, and no thing, is neither separate from it nor free from its effects. Food, metabolism, mobility, heating, lighting, weather, materials and their working, tools and their powering... all are energized. The musician in the hall, the orator in the square, the weaver on the loom, the farmer in the field, the homeless beggar on the street and the yogi in the cave – all are harnessing, utilizing, exchanging and transforming energy of various forms in various ways.
- Energy is integral and universal. So is time.
- Energy is integral and universal. Energy issues affect everyone. Energy futures reach everyone.

- Why energy?-1
- Energy is foundational, essential, universal and central to life and society. The fundamental importance of energy, and the massive, complex feedback effects of its acquisition and use, make it a worthy focus of pivotal inquiry. Life is characterized by various forms of energy exchange. Much of history’s social, economic and technological development could be described as the attempts to increase or improve the harnessing of energy sources and redistribution of energy outputs. Human existence has always been an exercise in the sourcing, organization and application of energies. It will continue to be so in the future.
- Why energy?-2
- Yet a review of much media and academic literature questions and speculates about the longevity, quality and nature of human civilization as a result of poor energy system management. Warnings of numerous threats of various kinds are issued by all sides of the debate. Energy is at the forefront of discussion, popularly and academically, perhaps as it has never been before. The discourse abounds via such complex issues as:   Climate change and climate justice  Biospheric integrity and pollution  Peak oil and resource availability  Population explosion  Nuclear waste, storage and accidents  Nuclear arms proliferation  Resource war and Terrorism  Fuel and electricity poverty and inequity  Economic recession, depression and development  Legal rights – land, property, visual, inter-generational etc.

- Oil is the single most traded commodity in the world. (Ref?) The global energy industry accounts for Z% of turnover (Ref?) Nations go to war over energy. Nations use energy to go to war. “Energy is the sole universal currency”(Smil, 2006). According to some historians, the rise and fall of civilization, the shifts and movements of political, economic and technological power, can all be said to be about the successful control of energy. (Ref?) Evolution is the process of managing more complex increased energy throughputs (Ref?) Economics can be seen as the energetic exchange of energy control (Ref?)

- The influences of the energy system are now wide-spread in scope, large-scale in size, far-reaching in time, and deep in effect.
- The consequences of the energy system are widespread, large-scale and far-reaching in time.
- Why energy?-3
- The appearance of just one of these global energy-related problems, each having potentially catastrophic near-term and long-term consequences, warrants a thorough investigation of the world’s energy planning, policy-making and strategizing. Their simultaneous congruence necessitates it. Every inhabitant on earth is affected by one or more of these energy-related issues. Moreover, with a globalized economy and meteorologcal system, the potential impacts of adverse effects will not be locally contained. With the importance of safe, secure, clean, and prosperous and efficient global energy systems paramount as never before, it is imperative that energy policy and policy-making be critically examined, understood and improved where possible. Those parties heavily invested in business-as-usual trajectories remain to benefit from improved energy futuring as nascent global trends and drivers emerge, and stakeholder power structures evolve.

- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-1
- The research focuses on “energy” rather than “climate change” primarily because anthropogenic climate change is seen, at one level, as a symptom of an energy problem, and not the underlying problem itself. The issue of climate change is not completely a subset of energy but there is a strong overlap in favour of energy being the broader issue of concern. Any response to climactic changes through mitigation and adaptation will require a change in energy policy, as well as energy to implement changes, responses and solutions.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-2
- According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ref?), the leading causes of human induced climate change are results of modern stationary energy generation, transport, agriculture and deforestation practices. While the first two in the list are obvious, agriculture and forestry serve as significant sources of energy, significant users of energy and significant sources and sinks of emissions. The food or fuel debate looms as a crisis point in an Australian biofuel future, as do “food miles” and a secure fuel supply. A result of this research may be to include the likes of agriculture and biomass management in the realms of energy policy to capture the full picture of the energy system and thus create better alternative energy futures.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-3
- It is also the author’s initial opinion that climate change driven energy research dominates energy discourse. Understandably, it presents a grand challenge with far-reaching consequences. However, it is hypothesized that climate change alone may not be a sufficient driver of strategy to ultimately address climate change. Furthermore, by focusing on climate change, other lesser publicized symptoms of the modern industrial energy system may be neglected. Climate change may be a symptom of modern energy policy and it may be one of many symptoms.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-4
- No doubt climate change sits as one of, if not, the major drivers of global and Australian energy futures. However, it is a sub-question of this research whether it sits as an effective driver of energy futures and policy. By taking an open energy futures focus, its theorized that alternative futures open up to include broader possibilities than if climate change were the sole driver. An open energy futures approach would seek address climate change as well as other energy issues, such as poverty and development, peak oil and a carbon based economy, terrorism and nuclear risks. An “energy futures” driven approach with biospheric integrity as a weighty element serves to complement the climate change driven research, enhancing the chances for social and economic prosperity, as well as environmental.

- Indeed, cursory internet searches and literature reviews reveal that myriad proposals, representing a wide spectrum of energy visions futures, already exist to meet the challenges around energy. In fact this has been the case for much of the 20th century with all manner of forecasts and strategies announced. [ref] Yet, energy forecasts are historically unreliable and unhelpful and are considered by some as “no more than fairy tales”. [ref Smil] Similarly, grand alternative energy schemes such as nuclear, renewables or space-based systems have largely failed to fruit as evangelized. [ref]
- Why energy?-5
- In the 1950’s and 1960’s nuclear energy was regarded by many as the panacea but the “electricity too cheap to meter” never eventuated. The 1970’s saw the emergence of the term “energy crisis”, experienced by some during the “unforeseen” OPEC oil embargoes. Renewable energy technologies were lauded as the road to energy independence but have failed to significantly penetrate thus far. In the almost 20 years since the 1992 World Earth Summit, the Kyoto Protocol and COP-15 Copenhagen meeting of 2009 have both been well-intentioned but ineffectual in the eyes of many, failing to produce the change they hoped for. Throughout the history of energy, the exaggerations are rife and the under-performance standard. Such recurring disappointments of strategies and proposals suggest a critical review of energy futures is overdue and an examination of the “energy crisis” and its responses is needed if this pattern is not to continue.
- Why energy?-6
- Climate change mitigation by carbon emission reduction, energy security and economic growth are currently seen as the dominant competing and oft-conflicting foci of energy discussion. However they are not equally, nor universally, held to be the primary challenges. The “energy crisis” is seen in different ways by many stakeholders, each according differing degrees of importance to the many sectors, actors and effects. Similar perspectives can spawn opposed responses while, conversely, opposing perspectives may promote similar means. The differences often escalate to make the arena quite ferocious and move from being “debate” to a “battle” for supremacy, often in the guise of “sustainability” or “growth”.

- Lack of previous work
- Lack of previous work   As briefly mentioned in section 1.2.1.2, an initial review of some energy futures literature indicates much futures work has been done though it is to be of a relatively limited nature. The limitations refer to the typologies of futures produced, determined by the methodologies employed. These are commonly forecasts and scenarios produced via economic, technological and/or climatic modelling. The associated visions, foundational assumptions or worldviews that are inherent in forecasts and scenarios are rarely rigorously analysed, developed or even articulated and acknowledged.  Similarly, particular energy issues are often treated in isolation based on the preferences of the stakeholder, or purely out of innocent ignorance or inability. Rarely are more than two or three drivers of energy futures situated together for comparison, contrast and combined futuring. Energy futuring has focused on certain things  Technology pathways and development Salvation by technology Forecasts and scenarios Received/passive futures Favoured structure, rather than agency Climate change Oil supply  No map exists Mention CSIRO, “The Heat is On” as the closest known to the author   Energy work hasn’t used futures much Transformative futures work hasn’t looked at energy much  Much questioning of solutions. But is there much questioning of the problem?  Agency has been lost! Dominated by forecasts!!  (Summary of Section 1.2.1) For a safe, secure, clean, prosperous, efficient energy system to become a reality begin to work now and in the future, we must first identify the energy futures we hold in the present. No adequate map currently exists of global energy futures locating the full array of stakeholders’ visions and strategies, as well as the drivers of their energy futures, that doesn’t simplistically reduce the richness of perspectives and array of alternatives. The growing database of models, forecasts and scenarios remain to be critiqued, using a toolbox of deep, transformative futures methodologies that have not been applied to energy as a whole, offering genuinely alternative pathways.  The need for the evolution of energy futuring methods mirrors developments around energy resources, technology and policy. We must identify the spectrum of futures that exist, aEnergy resources exist in various forms in various locations. This variety calls for an assortment of technologies to discover, evaluate, exploit, distribute and utilise them. The nature and knowledge of these sources, forms, tools and models has expanded and evolved over history. There is widespread difference of opinion on energy challenges and solutions but two of the things that are generally agreed upon are a) that there should be a greater mix of energy sources – a portfolio of solutions, and b) that we must use energy more wisely.  And so it must be with energy futures and energy futuring. This work hopes to identify and locate a broader pool of energy futures resources and evaluate them using previously untried methods. Subsequently, innovative techniques need be employed, in addition to traditional methods, to utilize new futures resources while extracting novel alternative product from conventional resources. A portfolio of genuinely alternative energy futures generated from a toolbox of energy futuring instruments creates the possibility for more robust, wiser energy policy.

- Physical energy (chemical, electrical, mechanical etc) is central to physical existence. Human development has, in part, been facilitated by increasingly intense energy usage. Alternatively, human development has seen increasingly intense energy usage result. Either way, the world is presently in a situation where the nature of this energy usage to this present time has potentially jeopardized and/or retarded further human development, as its been traditionally viewed. There is a strong link between social unrest and the quality of access to material resources, including energy. The threats posed by this and climate change as a result of our dominant energy systems and the mentalities behind them are present on a scale of previously unencountered extensiveness and degrees of severity.
- For the world-2
- Therefore, brought into the spotlight are the questions a) “What constitutes human development”? and b) “What energy systems can best facilitate that?” These questions are not new. Alone, each question has been asked at length. Together, in the same analysis, the asking has been less frequent. To a depth where conventional, orthodox notions of each have been transcended, I think these questions have rarely been combined.
- For the world-3
- In a nutshell, I see the forum of energy as a way of illustrating the fundamental spiritual nature of material resource issues. Neglect of spiritual considerations in the addressing of energy related matters will result in short-term fixes at best, often resulting in longer-term malaise. Addressing energy, and other material resource issues, provides the forum for spiritual, and thus fundamental human, development.
- For the world-4
- As an Australian, the choice of Australia as my sample is expected. However, as a primary energy producer with a society that is very energy intensive in a rapidly changing world, the importance of well-crafted energy policy and foresight can't be overstated. Furthermore, in contrast to many other primary energy producers and energy intensive nations of the world, Australia has the material wealth, levels of well-being and sufficient social development to successfully navigate into a better energy future, and perhaps blaze a trail for others to emulate.

- I want to become proficient in futures techniques.
- I see futures techniques and methods as being useful and attractive in my evolving career.
- I want to understand the world better.
- I see energy as a useful metaphor or link to understand diverse aspects of the world.
- I want to feel like I'm making a difference.
- Energy is universal and fundamental, as is technology. Having an influence in these fields may help the world somewhat.
- For me
- For me The significance of this research question is many-fold. I am interested in practically realizing far-reaching positive change in the world. Physical energy is a central and universal issue of fundamental importance and thus provides a forum for this. My academic background is in engineering so it seems an appropriate choice of issue.  However, In pursuing my engineering education the focus of my questioning moved from a technical “how?” to a social “what for?”. I had been involved in military-oriented research and this shift prompted a desire to a) move to a benign, peace-oriented field, and b) approach it from less of a purely technical perspective and more from a socio-economic point of view. I was drawn to the issues of sustainable energy policy for the chance to make a contribution to peace working more directly with the human aspect than the gadgetry. A big influence in this research was my meeting Dr Brian O'Leary. He is a former NASA astrophysicist-astronaut who now campaigns for “new energy”. “New energy” is a broad term covering technical devices and the science around them which test the limits of scientific orthodoxy. He, amongst others, has documented devices around the world which seem to generate heat and/or electricity in a way that contravenes scientific “law”. The most prominent of these might be the “cold fusion” episode. According to Dr O'Leary and a number of other reputable scholars, there exist these technologies, admittedly in a rudimentary stage, awaiting further development for application to alleviate many of the world's energy-related problems. However, as might be expected, there is resistance to their acceptance from various factions.  I am open to the possibilities of “new energy” having been given persuasive arguments and credible evidence, despite the existence of charlatans and fraudsters within the field. I would like to see these technologies introduced on a wide-scale in the world and so I am interested in addressing the barriers to their acceptance and promulgation, and thus the barriers to any “better” energy systems generally.

However, it is hypothesised that seeds of the crisis in energy also lies in:  i) The foundational ideas underlying energy thinking, such as in (science, economics, politics, planning, culture and behaviour; ii) An unwillingness and resistance in exploring these conceptual underpinnings.  This is an exercise in exploring problem re-definition, organizational transformation, and inter-stakeholder teamrelationship -building, conflict resolution, creating shared common visions and working towards them togetherunified action as much as it has been about techno-economic innovation and political maneuvering, yet it is the latter two which have been priveliged and over-emphasised..
- The effectiveness of energy futures could be augmented by the inclusion of key components.
- The effectiveness of energy futures could be augmented by the inclusion of key components.  The technological sophistication of many current energy futures has not seen them be adopted or endorsed. Advanced economic analysis of many futures hasn’t made them more attractive to other stakeholders. Many energy futures may be highly developed and very well reasoned, in certain areas, but underdeveloped or completely lacking in others. The acknowledgement of certain neglected features, and strategic development in these areas, may make energy futures more effective.  “I am right, you are wrong” thinking isn’t helpful. All stakeholders hold a key component of any solution, a more effective future. All stakeholders’ futures lack key components to it being an effective solution. An important component(s) is missing from all stakeholders’ approaches and views.

This is not an attempt to proclaim energy as the most important issue, rather to emphasise the inter-relatedness of problem structures.  we address this one central question, we can resolve many resulting problems. Yet, we must go further and address the underlying problem(s) of energy (see point 1
- Energy as symbol and metaphor
- Energy as symbol and metaphor The symbology and metaphor of energy and energy systems is undervalued and under-utilized.  As energyEnergy underpins/characterizes the both economy and ecology., and As both the economy areis symbolic and representative indicative of society, the energy system, energy policy and energy futures areis therefore symbolic of society. Thus, how Tthe transformation of the energy system occurs correlates with economic and ecological health and development. The stories, symbols, myths and metaphors we hold about energy play out in the material world, yet they are often not questioned in energy futuring, and technical and social analysis generally.  Identifying the energy stories we live by, and the energy images we hold dear, are critical pillars in the effort to create robust, prosperous energy systems.
- Current energy futures and futuring are under-achieving and ineffectual
- Current energy futures and futuring are under-achieving and ineffectual.  7. Dominant energy futuring processes do not agree with the range of impact of energy.The nature and scope of dominant energy futuring processes, energy futures content, energy system characteristics and energy usage consequences do not align coherently with each other. This is inefficient, ineffective and creates further problems rather than resolving them.  Each of these four elements need to be aligned for more effective futures and policy. The energy system touches people fundamentally, playing a critical role in quality of life. The full extent that energy system interacts with its surroundings, as well as itself, must be well understood and contained within energy futures and policy. This complexity and richness should be reflected in the processes and tools used to envision, plan and make decisions.   The degree to which this is done within current energy futures varies, with dominant energy futures considering only a limited range of energetic interactions, viewing society and environment primarily as mathematically modellable entitites. The full spectrum of the immeasurable and intangible human experience and natural value in the energetic environment is rarely considered in energy futures.   Exclusion or devaluation of this creates problems (e.g. environmental externalities and social dislocation). It is hypothesized that aligning energy futures techniques and content with the reach and extent of the energy system will enhance energy futures and policy. Its not energy that we want. What we want is what energy provides, enables or produces. Which energy services predominate in society, and how, reflect social values, norms, customs, culture and worldviews as much as technological availability. However, energy policy formulation and futuring generally ignore this, favouring “value-free” mechanical mathematical economic modeling and forecasts. Social and future dimensions of energy policy are an after-thought or, at best, an opinion poll.
- Energy futures are a driver of social development, or not.
- Energy futures are a driver of social development, or not.   Development of any kind requires energy. The quantity and quality of energy available (in the sense of characteristics as well as excellence), determine how organisations and ecosystems grow, and by how much. Therefore, energy futures correlate closely with  general futures. Broad future visions contain particular energy futures. In other words, competition between energy futures is competition between broader, general futures.  With a suitable energy vision and accompanying comprehensive strategy which inspires people, society and industry, the energy system could become a driver of grand dreams and mechanism of meaning. In the modern industrial age, characterized by technological energy developments, energy policy has largely been an afterthought in an uninspired quest for ultimately empty mirages of power and trinkets.
- The energy “debate” is, more accurately, energy “conflict”.
- The energy “debate” is, more accurately, energy “conflict”.   Debate and dialogue around energy futures has increasingly become war-like, or even war itself in some cases, as the potential effects of energy systems are explored, understood or unfold. Armed conflict driven by control of resources, venomous political argument, angry social demonstration, heated dinner discussion and vitriolic blog commentary testify to less genuine debate and moreso to battle.   Technical reasoning alone, in such cases, is insufficient and ineffective as a solution to the conflict. In fact, it may be part of the problem. As such, conflict resolution skills and relationship building may be equally helpful, and possibly in greater need now, rather than a primary focus on scientific proficiency, economic planning or political gamesmanship.
- Cause – effect confusion
- Cause – effect confusion  The common thinking is we must transform and develop our energy system for a peaceful, prosperous future. This work contends that we must transform our energy future in order to have a peaceful, prosperous socio-ecological system.  The transformation of the energy system to achieve sustainable development, economic growth, prosperity, or whatever other lofty aim, will only come as a result of the transformation of the selves who envision, plan, strategize and communicate. There is undoubtedly a mutual iterative feedback relationship between energy system change and changes in quality of life. Generally, though, we are more heavily invested in external energy system change without investigating the selves who attempt to enact it.  Energy futures do not generally advocate personal and inter-personal transformative practice as a tool. Due to this backwards reasoning of placing effect as cause and cause as effect, energy futures are inefficient according to their proclaimed objectives.

- Cause – effect confusion
- Cause – effect confusion.  The transformation of the energy system to achieve sustainable development will only come as a result of the transformation of our selves. Currently, and generally, we are attempting to reverse this process. By attempting to transform the energy system, we are hoping to transform society and thus, ultimately, our personal lives. Due to this backwards reasoning, energy futures are ineffectual, placing effect as cause and cause as effect. Transform the inner to transform the outer, rather than the other way around. A transformed energy system will bring a transformed social system (including economic system) and eco-system. But a transformed social system requires the inner transformation of society, or rather the inner transformation of selves. The process of transforming (cv. changing) the energy system towards a preferred future is the process of transforming the self.  Those seeking alternative energy futures do not generally understand this and continue to embody conventional thought patterns, resulting perhaps in superficially different systems that are fundamentally identical.
	- The process of transforming the energy system as the means of social development rather than a transformed energy system causing social/sustainable development. Changing (transforming) the energy system so that we can have “sustainable development” IS, in itself, the development. The change in practices, philosophies and methods, in planning and in carrying out the plans, is the development, rather than what goes on after the crisis is solved. It is the transformation, not the development that occurs afterwards. Energy is seen as the means of “development”. Yet it is the transformation of the energy system which is the development itself. If we can address energy system transformation fully, then the ensuing “development” is “sustainable” (or whatever characteristic) as a result of the nature of the energy system (or whatever system). It is the mindsets and consciousness of agents which have been transformed (or “released”), thus outlining the course of pathways from there. (Outer reflection of an inner condition. Transformation is of the inner condition.)  Similarly, wrt climate change. The climate change-energy/resource usage nexus is exactly the means by which human development can occur. Answering the question(s) is where the development occurs, not once the question is answered.I think the current view is “let's sort out the energy and water problems so we can grow and develop”. However, i reckon its now “we grow and develop BY sorting out the energy and water problems” If we incorporated inner dimensions (inner development) to energy futures then perhaps we wouldn’t have a repeat of climate change and/or peak oil threats. The real goal is inner development. Climate Change – Culture Change. There is a culture change because of climate change. Perhaps climate change could have been avoided or reduced because of a culture change.

- Energy's Role in Social Development
- We set our goals in society, industry etc THEN design the energy system to get these. Can we design our energy system first which then determines our goals in society, industry? In designing our energy system we are expressing our values, beliefs and attitudes. Perhaps we need to approach this solution from both ends... ie 1. Determine the goals of society/industry/business and from that determine the energy and resource requirements 2. Determine the possible theoretical energy production (according to certains sets of values, beliefs, attitudes, criteria eg. If only renewables, if only fossil fuels etc etc) and from that determine our social goals.  Energy Technology Innovation – The Energy-Social Development Chicken-Egg cycle How has the energy technology at any one place and time tied in with the social development there? What/which is driving/leading, and how? Do they take turns, iteratively spurring off one another? Discovering/harnessing fire/firewood and animals lead to social developments. These social developments then allowed the next phase of energy technology to be discovered/invented/harnessed. (What was that?) A cyclic process underway?  Energy technology ties in intimately with the other technology around it. Probably can’t do an energy macrohistory or energy tech trend identification without doing an overall tech one simultaneously.  Information production and distribution and its energy supply - Printing press, Internet  Transport  Food, agriculture  Housing, heating  Creativity – arts, science, philosophy... activities beyond basic necessities of the day  Is there a shift that needs to be made, in the following sense: We create and structure an energy system that fits our goals in the world. We want to build this, run that, travel there...so we set up the energy system that supports that. We do what it takes to set up that energy system. Now,instead, our energy system may need to EMBODY, and be a direct expression, of our goals in the world. [Coherence!!] This is almost like a retraction of our source of [true, inner]power being from outside [of the energy system] to within it. The values evident within the energy system were separate and distinct from the values of the goals we were trying to achieve. Now, at this time, perhaps this internalization needs to occur...?!?! Is our energy system already an expression of our values? I think so. Is it already an expression of our thoughts about ourselves? Perhaps need to consider energy’s role in contributing to levels of social satisfaction. Eg. More energy/fuel used to make more and more stuff which satisfies less and less.   PERHAPS NOW WE NEED TO BE DRIVEN BY POSSIBILITY RATHER THAN REACTING TO THREAT!!! Ie. Shift the driver of social change from response to threat and lack to one of fostering, promoting, encouraging, fomenting POSSIBILITY (of peace, prosperity, security). What possibility can we envision for Australia with regards to its energy system. What are the possibilities that the[new] energy system is opening up and allowing to be possible? In RESPONDING to climate change/global warming, peak oil, energy security issues, we can shift from being reactive to proactive. Let’s NOT ONLY respond to these issues powerfully, but go FURTHER to be drawn further into the future by our INSPIRED VISION.   Energy System’s Purpose? What does each party think the purpose of the energy system is? What are we providing energy FOR? What are the varying views? Is it REALLY for what we think its for? Can we come up with another purpose that will unite? Is the purpose of the energy system actually to UNITE!?!?! To promote a sense of UNITY! A feeling of oneness, unity, team, cohesion? Wow. What an idea! Feels good.  What are the symbolic metaphors each party has of energy and energy system’s evolution?
- Its not energy that we want
- Its not energy that we want. What we want is what energy provides, enables or produces. Which energy services predominate in society, and how, reflect social values, norms, customs, culture and worldviews as much as technological availability. However, energy policy formulation and futuring generally ignore this, favouring “value-free” mechanical mathematical economic modeling and forecasts. Social and future dimensions of energy policy are an after-thought or, at best, an opinion poll.
- Theoretical Orientation and Hypotheses incomplete
- Theoretical Orientation and Hypotheses  Theoretical Orientation Your aim here is to state your basic ideas on the topic.
	- First, state the various theoretical approaches taken in your topic. Which one do you propose to use in your research and why? Where, tentatively do you stand on the topic?   If there are various theories on your topic or in your field, which one(s) will you use in your conceptual framework for your thesis?   Which terms or trends do you wish to follow up from the literature review?   Do you have any fresh suggestions of an explanatory, interpretative, or programmatic kind? Ask Yourself . . .   Which pieces of research seem to have been most successful, the most promising and which less so?   What are the major lines of criticism that can be levelled at previous work?   What major omissions, gaps or neglected emphases can be identified?   Think it Through  Perhaps the best way to approach this section is to set down your main insights, hypotheses, hunches, or even hopes about your topic.  In view of past theory and research, and your emerging issues, what are the areas that you expect to have findings?   • Australia, and the world, face unprecedented challenges centred around its energy system.  • Novel approaches are required to come up with out-of-the box solutions to non-traditional energy crises.  • Numerous scenarios and visions of that energy future already exist and give birth to conflicting policies and strategies.  • Energy stakeholders are effectively in conflict. This conflict reduces the effectiveness of each and every stakeholder and their vision. • The goal is to make visions of Australia’s energy future more empowering and inspiring, and energy policy more effective in creating an Australia we all want. • The only way to do this is together, now. • Understanding of the problem doesn’t seem to exist. If it did then the solution would already have been implemented. Alternatively, it isn’t applied, wherein lies the problem. •
	- (this is my addition. Let’s say up to 100 words) The various inter-related hypotheses and ideas in the various ways I’ve expressed them.  1. This is a problem within the field of energy but its not a problem OF energy. 2. Each vision/strategy/approach has a piece of the puzzle. Each is partially “correct”. 3. Each approach is lacking some key ingredient which prevents it from being rapidly and smoothly implemented, right across the board 4. The puzzle may be lacking other pieces. There is lacking an overall “umbrella factor”, “glue” – an integrator 5. The missing ingredient in each is the same or similar in essence, though perhaps in a slightly different form. 6. With a suitable Energy Vision which inspires people, society and industry into action, the energy system can become a driver of dreams, and not just an afterthought to achieve dreams. There are as yet unrealized potential benefits in deliberately driving the transition to an energy future rather than manipulating or managing the current juggernaut’s path.  7. In essence, under superficial differences, the obstacles each stakeholder faces in realizing their vision of Australia’s Energy Future are the same obstacles each stakeholder faces in their own personal lives. 8. An(other) inspiring Vision of Australia’s Energy Future can be invented which will accelerate stakeholders to take coherent action.  Underlying Root Causes Barriers to implementing better futures pathways often framed as economic or technological lack. My hypothesis:  a) Economics nor technological lack not the real barriers. The issues are fundamentally human being problems,  psycho-spiritual. Imagination and belief. Cynicism. Lack of vision. b) To implement plans to realizing better futures, our psycho-spiritual nature must be consciously and directly engaged. We must do our spiritual homework (but perhaps without calling it that, or needing to express that explicitly.)  Pieces in a Puzzle Each vision/strategy has a piece of the puzzle. However there the puzzle may be lacking other pieces AND it may be lacking GLUE to make it secure and coherent. Each approach is lacking some key ingredient which prevents it from being rapidly and smoothly implemented, right across the board There is lacking an overall “umbrella factor”, “glue” – an integrator The missing ingredient in each is related though perhaps in a slightly different form Possible GLUE and missing ingredients can be identified perhaps through some Futures theory and methodology. GLUE can be applied and missing ingredients added through some Futures or other workshop type techniques to achieve ASCENT goals. There are key ingredients from the dominant energy strategies, policies and visions that make them hard to sell to a greater audience. There are key ingredients which are lacking making the proposals less than inspiring.  For the greater public, political world, economic world, society etc to adopt policy and strategy and visions there must be something present which is really enrolling them and getting them on board. What is that X factor?  PERHAPS THIS X FACTOR IS “THE UMBRELLA FACTOR” – THAT OVERARCHING, UNITING IDEA/PRACTICE/APPROACH WHICH PUTS ALL SEEMING DISPARATE EFFORTS ON THE SAME PAGE AND PULLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  Professional – Personal Disocciation  The barriers and obstacles to ASCENT are the same barriers and obstacles that each stakeholder faces in their own personal lives. Cynicism? Lack of vision?  lack of willingness to...? • challenge one's beliefs in the face of suffering • consider alternatives which challenge the comfort zone • challenge one's idea of Se  Conflict Resolution v Sci-tech-econ-politics?? Is “Australia’s Energy Future” issues are more about conflict resolution and mediating competing interests than technology, economics and politics?? Is this more about tempering competing visions of the future and uniting them? Could this be more about altering/modifying visions of the future so that competing visions mesh together and unite, resulting in cohesive harmonic effort? Could this be about helping others and facilitating others in expanding their visions of the future – what’s possible and how it can be possible – so that each and every one can see how we’re on the same team?  An effective solution will require co-operation, coherence and unity. This is an exercise in team-building, uniting, conflict resolution, creating shared common visions and working towards them together. The technicalities of the issue mask these fundamental points. My role is two-fold: Understand the technicalities sufficiently well such that The warring parties can be united That is, I can speak, and understand, the language of each player at the level of each player, AND I can translate each player’s language to the other players.   Energy Vision as a Driver of Social Development The climate change-energy/resource usage nexus is exactly the means by which human development can occur.  Answering the question(s) is where the development occurs, not once the question is answered. I think the current view is “let's sort out the energy and water problems so we can grow and develop”. However, i reckon its now “we grow and develop BY sorting out the energy and water problems   By co-operatively uniting and complementing our multiple competing visions of Australia’s energy future, we are all pulling together in the same direction. We not only secure our own future but blaze a trail of possibility for others to follow for a happier world.  Energy as Metaphor for human society Energy is central to human endeavour therefore addressing energy questions is addressing bigger human questions
- Transform the inner to transform the outer
- Cyclic contribution of inner and outer selves.  Must Transform the inner to transform the outer, as much as, if not mores than, transforming the outer in an (futile) attempt to change the inner.  A transformed energy system will bring a transformed social system (including economic system) and eco-system. But a transformed social system requires the inner transformation of society, or rather the inner transformation of selves. The process of transforming (cv. changing) the energy system towards a preferred future is the process of transforming the self.  Those seeking alternative energy futures do not generally understand this and continue to embody conventional thought patterns, resulting perhaps in superficially different systems that are fundamentally identical.   The process of transforming the energy system as the means of social development rather than a transformed energy system causing social/sustainable development. Changing (transforming) the energy system so that we can have “sustainable development” IS, in itself, the development. The change in practices, philosophies and methods, in planning and in carrying out the plans, is the development, rather than what goes on after the crisis is solved. It is the transformation, not the development that occurs afterwards. Energy is seen as the means of “development”. Yet it is the transformation of the energy system which is the development itself. If we can address energy system transformation fully, then the ensuing “development” is “sustainable” (or whatever characteristic) as a result of the nature of the energy system (or whatever system). It is the mindsets and consciousness of agents which have been transformed (or “released”), thus outlining the course of pathways from there. (Outer reflection of an inner condition. Transformation is of the inner condition.)   Similarly, wrt climate change. The climate change-energy/resource usage nexus is exactly the means by which human development can occur. Answering the question(s) is where the development occurs, not once the question is answered.I think the current view is “let's sort out the energy and water problems so we can grow and develop”. However, i reckon its now “we grow and develop BY sorting out the energy and water problems” If we incorporated inner dimensions (inner development) to energy futures then perhaps we wouldn’t have a repeat of climate change and/or peak oil threats. The real goal is inner development. Climate Change – Culture Change. There is a culture change because of climate change. Perhaps climate change could have been avoided or reduced because of a culture change.

- Use the energy spectrum metaphor, equating energy to consciousness. The energy policy stuff has to fit in to the ladder. That is, spiritual/consciousness development can be fitted to a wholistic energy spectrum model. The Wilber and SD's et al tiers of consciousness, Hawkins calibration scale can be modelled in energy terms.

However, i reckon its now “we grow and develop BY sorting out the energy and water problems”
- Clarification of energy crisis
- The term “energy crisis” needs clarification. There is a crisis and yes, it does involve energy. But it is not for a lack of oil, gas, solar radiation, wind or hydrogen. It is not for a lack of money or other physical materials. The energy which is lacking takes the form of political will,
- Subtle energy development
- An ideal conventional energy scenario realization requires subtle energy development. Idea of “energy” must be expanded to include “subtle” energy development (ie. Spiritual development) Conventional energy policy/scenario forecasting must include “subtle energy policy” Better/ideal energy policy creation and realization requires consciousness development.
- Energy spectrum ladder
- Placing physical energy in its proper place in the energy spectrum. That is... the material is currently seen as the source of life. This is arse-about. It needs to go in its rightful place, “down the ladder” in order of importance and life-giving ability. I imagine there could be various levels of subtle energy, which gives rise to physical energy. Within the range of physical energy, there is a sub-spectrum too: Tachyon to our detectable emf down to dense material.

- Why a Futures approach?
- Why a Futures approach?  (as opposed to modelling, forecasting etc.)
-
- This research is undertaken through the field of Futures Studies for a number of reasons:
- Complexity.
- Complexity. As stated earlier, energy is a universal, fundamental, complex issue replete with multi-dimensional interactions and feedback loops between diverse elements and with much historical weight. Futures Studies is multi-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary by nature and is potentially well-geared to addressing complexities of energy.
- Policy.
- Policy. Futures Studies provides a broad suite of tools to augment policy. It offers methodologies to improve the policy creation process as well as open up policy options to include previously unconsidered or unimagined possibilities. Futures Studies offers methods to return agency to individuals and groups in creating preferred futures rather than merely reluctantly receiving others’ unwanted probable used futures.
- Why deep, transformative, participatory futures studies?
- Why deep, transformative, participatory futures studies?   Futures Studies (FS) as a discipline, theory and set of methodologies is dealt with in more detail in section 1.5, Theory and Methodology. For the moment though, suffice to say that FS is the use of the concept of the future to assess, guide and interpret the present. Various schools of thought exist in FS, as will be outlined in greater detail in section 1.5. A deep, participatory, transformative futures approch is adopted here for the following reasons: This research is undertaken through the field of Futures Studies for a number of reasons:  1. Personal interest to the author.  2. Novelty.  A cursory survey of literature reveals energy futures are already routinely addressed via conventional economic, mathematic, engineering, geologic, ecologic and similar techno-economic and system science approaches. To the best of the author’s knowledge, there remains the need to adequately complement and contextualise these useful techniques with approaches beyond reductionist narrow hard science methods and mindsets, or shallow system science perspectives. FS offers tools that can place appropriate value on sophisticated orthodox techniques by recognizing their time and place of usefulness, while simultaneously enriching the discourse.  3. Ability to encompass complexity, depth and breadth of perspective. As stated earlier, energy is a universal, fundamental, complex issue. It is replete with multi-dimensional interactions, layers of meaning and perspective, and feedback loops between diverse physical and social elements, and carrieswith much historical and cultural weight. Futures Studies A deep, participatory futures approach is multi-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary by nature, acknowleding the wealth of stakeholders, the deep foundations of their views and is potentially well-geared to addressing complexities of energysuch complexity.   4. Policy influence. Futures StudiesFS provides a broad suite of tools to augment policy. In fact, futures underlie policy, whether a particular policy-maker agrees with it or not. [ref] It offers methodologies to improve the policy creation process as well as open up policy options to include previously unconsidered or unimagined possibilities. Futures StudiesFS offers methods to return agency to individuals and groups in creating preferred futures rather than merely unconsciously or reluctantly receiving others’ unwanted probable used futures.  5. Pragmatic utility. Much of the energy discourse focuses on the likelihood and implications of future events such as the forecast impacts of climate change or the timing of peak resource production. It thus seems the logical choice to use the methodologies of the study of the future to examine these predictions and forecasts. These tools may help to prepare for and alleviate any “future shock” – social and individual paralysis – arising out of an unexpected or unimagined future. Furthermore, futures tools provide means to proactively create a preferred future rather than feel helpless in the face of an imposed probable future. FS has potential to facilitate “transition midwifery” as the future unfolds and certain aspects of energy systems die while others gain ascendency.  6. Unifying capability. The fields and scope of inquiry available via FS is vast, sweeping the broad horizons of time and subject, plunging from surface inquiry to deep philosophical premises. While FS doesn’t offer the final answer, its domain of investigation enables multiple perspectives, approaches and worldviews to be situated together under one roof. In doing so, connections between them are now possible; common ground can be identified and reinforced while differences too can be seen and perspectivized.  FS not only allows for shades of grey but a merging of a spectrum of hues of varying intensities viewed at different resolutions.  7. Recontextualisation of technology. In an age where science and technology are highly prized, energy challenges can be seen purely as problems of physical and economic science, to which innovative technologies and market instruments are the solution. FS seeks not to devalue the role of technology in society but can increase its value by identifying the degree the techno-centric view contributes to shaping the problem. Understandings of the philosophical foundations of this view, available via deep, critical futures, can improve the effectiveness of technology as part of a preferred energy system.  8. Stakeholder empowerment and reclaiming of agency. The energy industry is behemoth with many stakeholders feeling isolated from decision-making. The forces of large energetic systems, such as the world’s climate or economy, can seem threatening and overwhelming, leading to disillusionment and despair. Focusing on seemingly invariant structures and probable forecasts in energy systems can erode personal and organisational power. Over-concentration on scenarios created by others limits possibility. Deep, participatory, transformative futures can help stakeholders reclaim and remember their power to mould their future rather than merely respond.  Redefining problem construction. Deep, participatory, transformative futures represent and contain a type of self-reflexive analysis which offer insights rarely available using traditional analytical methods. While it is postulated that deep participatory, transformative futures work will be beneficial in addressing energy problems, it is also posited that the absence of such investigative methods is an intrinsic part of the problem itself. In failing to examine fully all aspects of a stakeholders’ energy future, not only are problems produced and effectiveness reduced, it constitutes part of the very problem. Deep, participatory, transformative futures offer tools to allay this by complementing traditional, conventional techniques.

	- Now, more than ever, energy systems which promote life, peace and prosperity are urgently needed. The transition(s) to a better energy system must be rapid to avoid potential catastrophe such as climate change and reduce potential unnecessary suffering. The transition(s) must be smooth to minimize social disruptions from such things as finite oil supply and environmental degradation.

- Limits of Research
- 1.6 Limits of Research  To guide the reader, as well as to clearly distinguish this work from any mistaken idea of lumping it with the plethora of energy “futures” works pieces already available, this section succintly presents the essence of the research. Here is summarised what this research is about, what its not about, what it does and doesn’t cover, and what it will, and will not, do.
- Not the stockmarket, speculation or trading.
- This work has nothing directly to do with the speculation of energy commodity prices on the “futures” market. It is concerned with the traditional sense of the word “future” as “a time yet to come”, which carries with it expectations, aspirations, fears, historical inertia, wildcard and outlier events (both foreseen and unforeseeable), cyclic phenomena and the unconscious becoming conscious.
-
- Using critical and transformative futures theory and methodologies applied to gross energy supply, distribution and usage, the over-arching aim is to create more inspiring and more robust energy futures, with a goal being to assist the healing of conflict within the energy domain.
- Not prediction or forecasting.
- Forecasts have been, and will likely continue to be, one of the two dominant futuring efforts in energy and resources. There is no shortage of forecasts and predictions and therefore no need for this research to add to the list, except where the nature of the forecast or prediction may be distinctly novel. It is argued that forecasting is over-emphasised to the detriment of itself energy futures and the method itself, devaluing its very own worth. While energy forecasts can have a useful planning and provocative role, they are also typically inaccurate and unstable. [Ref & Citations]  Excessive reliance on forecasting also devalues the role of agency, resigning our lot to uncontrollable external factors and “hidden hands”. The view is we merely need to know what has already been determined to happen in the future and situate our organiszation most strategically.   Distinct from “foresight” which carries more of a capacity-building connotation, forecasting narrows and closes the future, which is often neither accurate or empowering [use quotes here on limitations of forecasting]. Forecasting undoubtedly does have its value, particularly in its identification of negative business-as-usual trends. The argument here is that it is over-valued and over-exercised.  Rather, this research will look at athe wider spectrum of methods used in energy futuring, encouraging the increased use of those which open up the future and create space for the generation of authentic, empowering alternaives.
- Distinct from climate change policy and response.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?  The research focuses on “energy” rather than “climate change”. This is for a number of reasons. From an initial literature survey, it is the author’s opinion that climate change driven energy research dominates energy discourse. Understandably, climate change presents a grand challenge with far-reaching consequences. However, it is not the sole driver of energy futures. This research intends to explicate that.
-
- In fact, it is hypothesised that climate change alone may not be a sufficient or effective driver of energy futures to ultimately address climate change. An inappropriately heavy focus on climate change is a driver of energy futures may indeed limit the efficacy or appeal of energy futures.  The purpose of taking a critical futures approach to the topic of energy is to “open up” the future, rather than reinforce hegemonic views.
-
- As a counter-balance, one would hope to see the futures of climate change (as opposed to the geophysical futures of the climate) thoroughly investigated as well, though this will be beyond the scope of this study.  At one level, primarily because anthropogenic climate change is seen in this research, at one level, as a symptom of an energy problem, and not the underlying problem itself. From the point of view of this research, “responding to climate change” highlights the cause-effect confusion hypothesised in this work, rather than responding to the socio-economic energy systems which produced it. By focusing on climate change, other lesser publicised symptoms of the modern industrial energy system may be neglected.
-
- Furthermore, the issue of climate change is not completely a subset of energy but there is a strong overlap in favour of energy being the broader issue of concern. Any response to climactic changes through mitigation and adaptation will require a change in energy policy, as well as energy to implement changes, responses and solutions.
-
- According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ref?), the leading causes of human induced climate change are results of modern stationary energy generation, transport, agriculture and deforestation practices. While the first two in the list are obvious, agriculture and forestry serve as significant sources of energy, significant users of energy and significant sources and sinks of greenhouse gas emissions. The “food or fuel” debate looms as a crisis point in  biofuel energy futures, as do “food miles” and a secure fuel supply for food supply.
-
- A result of this research may be to directly include the likes of agriculture and biomass management within the realms of energy policy to capture the full picture of the energy system and thus create better alternative energy futures.  It is also the author’s initial opinion that climate change driven energy research dominates energy discourse.
-
- Understandably, it presents a grand challenge with far-reaching consequences. However, it is hypothesised that climate change alone may not be a sufficient driver of strategy to ultimately address climate change. Furthermore, by focusing on climate change, other lesser publicised symptoms of the modern industrial energy system may be neglected. Climate change may be a symptom of modern energy policy and it may be one of many symptoms. No doubt climate change sits as one of, if not, the major drivers of global energy futures. However, it is a sub-question of this research whether it sits as an effective driver of energy futures and policy. By taking an open energy futures focus, its theorised that alternative futures open up to include broader possibilities than if climate change were the sole driver. An open energy futures approach would seek address climate change as well as other energy issues, such as poverty and development, peak oil and a carbon based economy, terrorism and nuclear risks. An “energy futures” driven approach with biospheric integrity as a weighty element serves to complement the climate change driven research, enhancing the chances for social and economic prosperity, as well as environmental.
- Suggestive, not prescriptive.
- Offering alternatives rather than answers or prescribe pathways. The literature is replete with “solutions” for a sustainable, secure, clean, green, prosperous, cheap, limitless, safe, [insert adjective here] energy future. The language is strong and the arguments are unequivocal, often carrying a sense of intellectual superiority and finality. “My way is the best because…”   This research argues that this very prescriptive approach constitutes part of the problem – the poor ability to compromise, contextualize and co-operate. Rather, this work adopts the idea that a) everyone has, and is, part of the answer; and b) no one has all of the answer; and c) the answer, or part thereof, is best generated from within, not provided from without.
- Macroscopic view over microscopic
- More concerned with trends, deep patterns, underlying myth and process. The details of energy futures, and their surface critique, constitute the feedstock of this work. They are readily available to the reader via the bibliography and there is no need to repeat them.
-
- The aim of this work is to introduce depth and breadth to what might be considered a narrow and shallow discourse. This work will attend to the detail of energy futures to the degree required to ascertain the essential, underlying structures and features, as well as the goals for which they are created. These may differ from the descriptions given by stakeholders themselves.  Alternatively, detail may be focused upon where the energy future expressed is novel or little known. This work hopes to introduce an energy future that is novel in content to every reader in the effort to present a wider range of genuine alternatives.
- Process determines content and results
- With an understanding that the results (content) of investigation and analysis are, to a large degree, determined by the tools used and the procedure followed, this study prioritises examination of the methods employed in creating energy futures, and their inherent assumptions. This is where a focus on detail is more likely to be apparent. “Pay attention to the process, and the results will take care of themselves”, is the adage that is relevant here.
- Not questioning validity of drivers.
- In this work it is the intention to minimize moralising, steer clear of debate over whether climate change due to anthropogenic global warming is real or not; or whether peak oil is a valid phenomenon or not.
- Will not repeat what is done at length elsewhere in the mainstream energy debate..
- The purpose of this work is to recontextualise and reframe the energy debate, not repeat and rehash what has gone before.   The intention is to respect all futures, not to question the validity of. However, it is the intention to question their effectiveness in realising their purported objectives. In particular, climate change debate, technology validity debate, financial mechanisms debate etc. It will instead attempt to look at what underlies each of the positions on these energy-related issues.
- Not Discuss technologies in detail.
- This is done by many others
-
- It will, however, call into question
- Shining a light on current energy futures
- Mapping energy futures. Uncovering hidden factors that may be powerful forces in directing the world’s energy future.

- To be positioned in Global Effort and (possibly) edited for MQGEF inclusion
- Aims of Global Effort as an intellectual research exercise
- 1. To survey the manifold, disparate energy futures instances (tooltip: the particular propositions put forward for energy futures, as well as their creators, supporters). This also includes energy future techniques and practices ie. how energy futures are constructed. Who is proposing what, how are they arriving at their preferred pathways and plausible visions, and why?
- 2. To classify and group these myriad energy futures. To make the energy futures discourse more manageable by simplification into types and categories yet maintain the required distinctions. When we boil it down what can we really choose from at the moment?
- 3. To critically analyse and deconstruct these energy futures. Apply some novel analytical frameworks to uncover elements within the energy future instance which are assumed, opaque and unarticulated. What are these energy futures implying without saying it, what are the meaning without signifying it?
- 4. To map energy futures. That is, using a variety of theoretical frameworks and non-geospatial axes, situate these energy futures in knowledge space. How do energy futures (individual instances as well as types) compare to others and relate to each other? What dimensions of analysis could be used?
- 5. To expand the discourse and spectrum of discussion and debate around energy futures. Introduce and encourage levels of depth and disregarded alternatives. What discussion is avoided? What is repeated ad-nauseum with no breakthrough? What proposals are ignored, ridiculed or even suppressed? What lies at or beyond the limits of the maps?
- 6. Work with stakeholders to make their energy future more robust and useful. What additions, deletions or modifications could help stakeholders’ preferred energy futures become more widely or more quickly adopted? Upon reflection, do stakeholders still want their previously preferred futures?
- 7. To generate novel, genuinely alternative energy futures. This requires rigorously identifying and analysing what exists already. Is something genuinely novel possible? Would it be worthwhile? Attractive? How might this be done?
- As of Global Effort as a platform
- Web platform
- Global Effort hopes to incorporate web technologies to communicate its discoveries and ideas. This may include
- Searchable catalogue of energy futures instances and types with their properties and attributes.
- Argument maps and debate graphs of energy-related issues and futures thinking.
- Collaborative knowledge generation and dissemination.
- Visualization of energy futures. Graphically locating energy futures in geometrical space, as well as non-verbally representing energy futures.
- Community building around deep energy futures. High-quality moderated discussion forum for novel analyses of energy futures topics unavailable elsewhere. Cultivating energy literacy, futures literacy and reflective practice is the goal here.
-
- Social and business platform
- More broadly, Global Effort sees itself as an advocate rather than an overt activist. Its not designed to advocate for a particular energy future, even though contributors may hold personal preferences and visions. Rather, its aimed at facilitating energy futures that work for more in the face of some substantial inertia and forceful counter-weights. Our research and ideas may be used by activists from any side, but does not imply that we necessarily support their position, goals or methods.
- As a burgeoning business entity, Global Effort consults with organisations that seek to make change and exert influence in energy futures directions, both externally and internal to the organisation. Confronting blind spots, easing internal resistance, increasing internal buy-in, navigating paradigm shift, mapping capacity development will be features of our work along with trend analysis, scenario development and future-proofing.
- Overview of Global Effort
- Welcome to Global Effort.
- Global Effort is a platform for exploring Global Energy Futures, Foresight and Transitions.
- To elaborate slightly on the obvious, it operates at the intersection of:
- Energy - fossil fuels, renewables, nuclear, as well as exploring some unconventional technologies
- Futures - scenarios, forecasts, models, roadmaps, pathways, visions etc. (ie. not ‘futures’ as in speculative commodity prices)
- Foresight - processes, tools, techniques and methods to develop and construct futures
- Socio-technical transitions - socio-economic shifts in predominant technological systems
-
- ROLES & PURPOSE
- It is hoped that Global Effort will evolve over time to fill multiple roles and serve many purposes. This progression is only broadly linear with multiple phases being undertaken concurrently.
- 1. A platform for documenting the learnings and developments in the PhD studies of Adam Duus.
- 2. A repository of data relevant to the topics.
- 3. An atlas of energy futures maps.
- 4. A community of energy futurists, practitioners and laypeople.
- 5. A consultancy and think-tank.
-
- AIMS & OBJECTIVES
- The broad aims and objectives are to address some driving questions which should hopefully manifest in a sequence of overlapping cycles.
- 1. To survey the manifold, disparate energy futures instances (tooltip: the particular propositions put forward for energy futures, as well as their creators, supporters).
- 2. To map (locate in knowledge space) energy futures.
- 3. To critically analyse and deconstruct these energy futures.
- 4. To expand and deepen the discourse around energy futures.
- 5. Work with stakeholders to make their energy future more robust and useful.
- Read more about the objectives and purpose.
-
- Global Effort also means what it says, literally: to undertake any transition towards a more beneficial energy system will require a global effort; not only global in geography and global in scope. That is to say contributions will be needed from, and for, all parts of the world, all sectors of society, all disciplines of scholarship, all levels of reality, all aspects of self, all moments of the time-line. While I may have a preferred energy future, Global Efforts initial objective is to acknowledge the positions and preferences of each existing energy future.

-
- Welcome to Global Effort
- Global Effort is a platform for exploring Global Energy Futures, Foresight and Transitions. It sets out to evolve into greater capacities over time, though not necessarily in a strictly linear flow.
- Stage 1
- 1. A platform for documenting the learnings and developments in the PhD studies of Adam Duus. Very early stages of PhD studies at the University of the Sunshine Coast, in Australia. Prospectively titled “Mapping and Questioning Global Energy Futures.” Supervisor(s) to be confirmed. This requires much reading and writing, obviously. The platform of a blog (theoretically) encourages regular writing, structure within/between the writing, invites commentary and feedback, and establishes an on-line presence. Thoughts, ideas, article summaries, interesting learnings and discoveries, book reviews, meta-reflections, an aggregator of news feeds and social media…, all for primarily my own purposes, would be most of the elements at this stage of the platform.
- 2. A repository of data relevant to the topics. The grist for the PhD mill, all stored in one convenient location. The extra effort of placing it online forces further engagement with the content, and hopefully deeper learning. The data might include macroscopic data on energy supply & demand, a growing catalog of energy futures instances, key thinkers, influencers and organisations, summaries of publications, frameworks and typologies, energy-related theories and more.
- 3. An introduction to the field of Futures Studies. While people have been thinking about tomorrow since time began, it has only emerged as an academic discipline and formal set of tools in the last 50~60 years. As a set of theories and tools it holds great power beyond mere academia and a basic appreciation can be leveraged for great personal benefit in any field. Global Effort applies theoretical frameworks and methodologies from Futures Studies to energy systems around the world, so it makes sense to have a primer/catalog.
- Stage 2
- As a result of the preceding work, Global Effort hopes to develop further.
- 4. An atlas of energy futures maps and a catalog of debate/argument visualisations. Not maps in terms of geography, geology or weather (as is naturally common when talking about energy resources) but rather locating futures instances (ideas, proposals, visions) and perhaps their elements (actors, technologies, policy mechanisms) along myriad dimensions and axes of the energy futures landscape. As a conventional map uses dimensions such as latitude/longitude, elevation and isobars and such features as colour coding for, say, aridity or population density, the same or similar can be done for futures. Futures instances can be situated along axes determined by using a particular theoretical framework. These futures instances can occupy multiple frameworks, and occupy a different spatial location in that. Global Effort seeks to explore further this intersection of Futures Mapping and Knowledge Cartography for the case of energy futures, to produce a panorama for navigation into the future.
- 5. A community of like-minded energy futurists, practitioners and laypeople interested in learning more, sharing insights and developing ideas and practices. While Global Effort is starting out as a one-man endeavour, its goal is not to remain that way. Its aim is to invite and encourage contributions (with due acknowledgement) from other interested parties, whether that be in the form of opinion pieces, debates (which shall be summarised visually for easy digestion)
- 5. A consultancy and think-tank of experts and professionals engaging with the community at large through publications, workshops, lectures and debates. The goal is not to remain theoretical and/or isolated, locked in the ivory tower. That is the easy part. The real challenge comes from building bridges, deconstructing walls, digging for ore and generating energy with, within and between stakeholders. It involves taking energy futures out of hard sciences and mechanistic interaction and introducing soft skills and a human dimension.

- Limits: What GE is NOT
- We can further explain what GE is, or attempts to be, by contrasting it with what it is not, or attempts not to be.
- Global Effort is NOT:
- 1. A prescription for our energy future. It does not attempt to say this is what we should or must do. No ‘my way or the highway.’ Instead, Global Effort is more like a street directory: what are the possible pathways to get from energy present to energy future X. It collates all the prescriptions and suggestions that others have made, and looks more closely at them using lenses that they themselves most likely did not use. It is hypothesised that this analysis may improve each energy future in some way, and possibly even generate a set of alternative pathways for consideration.
- 2. A wiki of techno-economic energy ‘solutions’. Neither is Global Effort a wiki containing isolated articles about technologies or economic instruments which could or should be used to remedy or rectify the energy ‘crisis’ as defined by the proponent. What ‘solutions’ are proposed depends on what the ‘problem’ is. Global Effort will survey definitions of the energy crisis and their subsequently suggested solutions.
- Rather, an aim of Global Effort is to analyse particular energy futures using various approaches and situate them in the larger energy futures discourse. Rather than just record what is out there, Global Effort shall classify, group, compare-contrast, distill and map, such that genuinely alternative futures are identified.
- Wikis tend to be quite ‘flat’ in their knowledge structure. Yes, they may go into detail but not so much depth in terms of a critical philosophical framework. Conventional wiki informational nodes are connected in a flatland horizontal structure via simple hypertext links. Global Effort attempts to situate the same energy futures information within hierarchical and 3-dimensional (or more) knowledge frameworks via ‘vertical’ relational linking. This way, energy futures can be more critically investigated for such things as underlying assumptions and premises and over-arching ambitions. Traditionally, wiki info is presented in isolation, out of context. Global Effort, in contrast, situates this information in context, in the bigger narrative that is being told, explicitly or implicitly.
- 3. Technologically or economically focused. Most proposals centre around debates over technology choices and economic policy instruments. These are no doubt fundamentally important, however Global Effort takes the view that perhaps an over-emphasis on this approach is part of the very problem they are trying to solve. There are a wider and deeper array of factors to consider, and their denial may perpetuate or, at best, merely postpone problems.
- 4. A first-order data source. Similar to the above, Global Effort does not intend to store data just to be a database. Much excellent work is already done on such things as energy supply and demand, climate forecasts, energy poverty etc. There is no need to have yet another blog presenting these. Instead, Global Effort will pull data from these authoritative, reliable sources to compare and contrast competing visions and claims. It will present data to support or contest identified energy futures and their arguments. Naturally, all data sources are referenced.
- 5. A soapbox for rants, sophisticated or not-so-subtle, for or against a particular ‘conventional’ position on energy. It is not a community to gather for or against climate ‘alarmists’, climate ‘deniers’, peak oil ‘debunkers’, peak oil ‘fearmongerers’, renewables ‘dreamers’, fossil fuel ‘cavemen’… All these futures positions will be under the microscope. Global Effort does not purport to be unbiased or impartial - positions will be taken and stances stated. However, it will most likely be along lines that are novel and unconventional, as a result of research and analysis.
- Global Effort is unique in some ways, contrasting with some similar projects.
-
- The People behind Global Effort
- Who By, and Who For?
-
- Global Effort is the creation of me, Adam Duus. At the outset it serves as the mechanism for development of my PhD studies, though this is far from its only or final purpose.
- In time, Global Effort hopes to become a community of deep energy futurists, offering an alternative take on the majority of forecasters and stakeholder positions through collective critique and insight. I would like to invite others with their cutting insights and brilliant inspiration to improve, complement and correct my work. Subject matter experts in energy, futures, socio-technical change and otherwise, would be welcome to augment and argue such that the full terrain of energy futures discourse is visible and navigable.
- I would also like to invite contributors of other skills: web tool developers, data visualisers, social media networkers, graphic designers, digital community advocates…to bring their skills to bear on what is a very multi-faceted issue.

- An Overview of Driving Questions
- Global Effort derives out of some central questions which trigger some further, downstream questions. It centres around energy, of course, but also serves as an introduction and primer for Futures Studies.
- What are the world’s energy futures? That is, what do the world’s energy systems look like in the future? What are stakeholders proposing, envisioning, forecasting, openly or secretly fearful of? What energy futures dominate the discourse? What are fringe? What are probable, plausible and possible energy futures?
- What are the world’s futures given these energy systems? Energy is so integral and universal that we cannot separate the energy system from social structures powered by it.
- Why might we want alternative energy futures? That is, alternative “energy futures” as well as “alternative energy” futures. What are the drivers, the rationales, the agendas? Our objectives can determine our means.
- How are these particular energy futures arrived at? What tools, theories and frameworks are applied? What approaches are over-used, improperly used, neglected? What is their record of success, accuracy or helpfulness?
- Can alternative energy futures be generated? What knowledge cartographies exist to map the current discourse and therefore identify new terrains, short cuts, “edges of the world”? Will use of certain analytical approaches identify deeper similarities and differences, thus making novelty possible? How are energy futures currently categorised? Are there typologies and taxonomies of (energy) futures which can assist in understanding? Are there outliers and wild cards which no one is really talking about…yet?
- Global Effort explores the futures of energy but also uses energy to explore the field of futures and foresight. Therefore general questions around futures are also investigated, such as:
- What is the difference between futures, strategy and policy? How do they inter-relate?
- What are deep, critical, transformative futures, as opposed to shallow, predictive futures?
- What futures methodologies exits? What are traditional and common? What are novel and innovative?
-
- These are the tip of the iceberg. As with any investigative endeavour, new questions are generated as answers are discovered.
-

- An Overview of the Reasons for the Research
- Purpose and Rationale of Global Effort
- It is hoped that Global Effort will evolve over time to fill multiple roles and serve many purposes. This progression is only broadly linear with multiple phases in parallel, developed to different stage.
- 1. A platform for documenting the learnings and developments in the PhD studies of Adam Duus. Thoughts, ideas, article summaries, interesting learnings and discoveries, book reviews, meta-reflections. The purpose and rationale of Adam’s PhD research is discussed in more detail here.
- 2. A repository of data relevant to the topics. This would include macroscopic data on energy supply & demand etc but also a catalog of energy futures instances, key thinkers, influencers and organisations, summaries of publications, frameworks and typologies, energy-related theories and more.
- 3. An atlas of energy futures maps; not maps in terms of geography but rather locating futures instances and actors along myriad dimensions and axes of the energy futures landscape. The dimensions of these maps and the “co-ordinates” of the energy futures instances will begin to emerge out of our research.
- 4. A community of like-minded energy futurists, practitioners and laypeople interested in learning more, sharing insights and developing ideas and practices.
- 5. A consultancy and think-tank of experts and professionals engaging with the community at large through publications, workshops, lectures and debates.
- Purpose and Rationale of PhD Research
- The purpose of my (Adam’s) PhD research is to set out to answer the central driving questions. Summarised again here, they are:
- What are the world’s energy futures?
- Are they really different? If so, how so?
- How are these energy futures created?
- Are alternative energy futures possible? Can novel analytical tools and theoretical frameworks be used to generate and incorporate genuine alternatives?
- Furthermore, my research intends to introduce approaches not only from Futures Studies but Knowledge Cartography to map, cognitively and visually, the energy futures landscape. Just as geographical features are mapped for navigation, and geological strata is mapped for resource identification, the energy futures landscape warrants mapping to navigate the dangerous shoals and locate the high-yield ore.
- Just like any PhD research, its rationale is tied to its innovation and novelty.
- A plethora of energy futures exist giving an impression of an abundance of choice. However, nowhere (to my knowledge) have these futures been a) collated to get an accurate figure or representation of the number or proposals, and the stakeholders behind them and b) classified into schema which actually identifies the real options available and who is promoting their adoption, and why.
- There exists no work, to my knowledge, which applies critical futures studies tools such as Causal Layered Analysis to deepen the analysis of these energy futures to illuminate underlying features. It is hypothesised that what may appear distinct on the surface is rather similar and repetitive when the underbelly is exposed.
- The importance of all this arises from the significant modern consequences of our energy systems. Climate change, peak oil, energy poverty, nuclear contamination, energy “sieging” (think Russia’s control of European gas sources), oil-derived conflict, nuclear weapons programs, environmental pollution and resource-based terrorism; the litany of potentially grave social, economic and environmental consequences of energy system design and use is long and recalcitrant.
- Energy futures are critical in and of themselves, being a traditional, universal need in the form of food, labour and transport as well as more recent services such as communication, lighting, heating-cooling and so on. However, furthermore, energy futures represent our source of peace and prosperity, security or scarcity as energy drives our biophysical ecosystems and socio-economic engines. The question is to what are we driven? Where do we drive ourselves? Environmental collapse? Social conflict? Self-destruction? Or genuine prosperity, security and peace? Energy is central to all this. Energy futures symbolise our future dreams in present plans and preparations.

- A more beneficial energy system
- What does this actually mean?
- A purpose of Global Effort is to analyse this very question. What a better energy system looks like varies between stakeholders. Even broadly speaking it may look similar (eg. more reliable, cleaner, more secure etc) but at a finer resolution it can look quite different.
- The purpose of Global Effort is not to dictate what that better energy system is, rather to survey energy futures (proposals, scenarios, visions etc) and ask some questions about that ‘better energy system’
- What does it looks like. Not only technologically but socially, economically, politically,
- Who benefits? Often there are hidden power dynamics and inequalities.
- When? How ‘far’ is the future away? Do you consider 10 years long term? 100 years? 1000 years?
- How to achieve the proposals? The focus is often techno-economic. Cultural, behavioural, psycho-spiritual and other aspects can be neglected.
- What is not said? Assumptions. Biases. Outliers and wild cards. Devalued, disowned and disregarded aspects.
- What is new, if anything? New technologies, same socio-economic structures? New dogs (actors), old tricks (policies)? New drivers (problems), same response profiles?

- Why energy? -1
- Energy is life. It is essential to all systems. At a micro-level, energy is intrinsic to all systems. At a social level, all human activity is characterized by the acquisition, harnessing and use of energy. Energy is central. No one, and no thing, is neither separate from it nor free from its effects. Food, metabolism, mobility, heating, lighting, weather, materials and their working, tools and their powering... all are energized. The musician in the hall, the orator in the square, the weaver on the loom, the farmer in the field, the homeless beggar on the street and the yogi in the cave – all are harnessing, utilizing, exchanging and transforming energy of various forms in various ways.
- Energy is integral and universal. So is time.

- Why energy?-1
- Energy is foundational, essential, universal and central to life and society. The fundamental importance of energy, and the massive, complex feedback effects of its acquisition and use, make it a worthy focus of pivotal inquiry. Life is characterized by various forms of energy exchange. Much of history’s social, economic and technological development could be described as the attempts to increase or improve the harnessing of energy sources and redistribution of energy outputs. Human existence has always been an exercise in the sourcing, organization and application of energies. It will continue to be so in the future.
- Why energy?-2
- Yet a review of much media and academic literature questions and speculates about the longevity, quality and nature of human civilization as a result of poor energy system management. Warnings of numerous threats of various kinds are issued by all sides of the debate. Energy is at the forefront of discussion, popularly and academically, perhaps as it has never been before. The discourse abounds via such complex issues as:   Climate change and climate justice  Biospheric integrity and pollution  Peak oil and resource availability  Population explosion  Nuclear waste, storage and accidents  Nuclear arms proliferation  Resource war and Terrorism  Fuel and electricity poverty and inequity  Economic recession, depression and development  Legal rights – land, property, visual, inter-generational etc.

- Why energy?-3
- The appearance of just one of these global energy-related problems, each having potentially catastrophic near-term and long-term consequences, warrants a thorough investigation of the world’s energy planning, policy-making and strategizing. Their simultaneous congruence necessitates it. Every inhabitant on earth is affected by one or more of these energy-related issues. Moreover, with a globalized economy and meteorologcal system, the potential impacts of adverse effects will not be locally contained. With the importance of safe, secure, clean, and prosperous and efficient global energy systems paramount as never before, it is imperative that energy policy and policy-making be critically examined, understood and improved where possible. Those parties heavily invested in business-as-usual trajectories remain to benefit from improved energy futuring as nascent global trends and drivers emerge, and stakeholder power structures evolve.

- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-1
- The research focuses on “energy” rather than “climate change” primarily because anthropogenic climate change is seen, at one level, as a symptom of an energy problem, and not the underlying problem itself. The issue of climate change is not completely a subset of energy but there is a strong overlap in favour of energy being the broader issue of concern. Any response to climactic changes through mitigation and adaptation will require a change in energy policy, as well as energy to implement changes, responses and solutions.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-2
- According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ref?), the leading causes of human induced climate change are results of modern stationary energy generation, transport, agriculture and deforestation practices. While the first two in the list are obvious, agriculture and forestry serve as significant sources of energy, significant users of energy and significant sources and sinks of emissions. The food or fuel debate looms as a crisis point in an Australian biofuel future, as do “food miles” and a secure fuel supply. A result of this research may be to include the likes of agriculture and biomass management in the realms of energy policy to capture the full picture of the energy system and thus create better alternative energy futures.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-3
- It is also the author’s initial opinion that climate change driven energy research dominates energy discourse. Understandably, it presents a grand challenge with far-reaching consequences. However, it is hypothesized that climate change alone may not be a sufficient driver of strategy to ultimately address climate change. Furthermore, by focusing on climate change, other lesser publicized symptoms of the modern industrial energy system may be neglected. Climate change may be a symptom of modern energy policy and it may be one of many symptoms.
- Why “energy” and not “climate change”?-4
- No doubt climate change sits as one of, if not, the major drivers of global and Australian energy futures. However, it is a sub-question of this research whether it sits as an effective driver of energy futures and policy. By taking an open energy futures focus, its theorized that alternative futures open up to include broader possibilities than if climate change were the sole driver. An open energy futures approach would seek address climate change as well as other energy issues, such as poverty and development, peak oil and a carbon based economy, terrorism and nuclear risks. An “energy futures” driven approach with biospheric integrity as a weighty element serves to complement the climate change driven research, enhancing the chances for social and economic prosperity, as well as environmental.

- Indeed, cursory internet searches and literature reviews reveal that myriad proposals, representing a wide spectrum of energy visions futures, already exist to meet the challenges around energy. In fact this has been the case for much of the 20th century with all manner of forecasts and strategies announced. [ref] Yet, energy forecasts are historically unreliable and unhelpful and are considered by some as “no more than fairy tales”. [ref Smil] Similarly, grand alternative energy schemes such as nuclear, renewables or space-based systems have largely failed to fruit as evangelized. [ref]
- Why energy?-5
- In the 1950’s and 1960’s nuclear energy was regarded by many as the panacea but the “electricity too cheap to meter” never eventuated. The 1970’s saw the emergence of the term “energy crisis”, experienced by some during the “unforeseen” OPEC oil embargoes. Renewable energy technologies were lauded as the road to energy independence but have failed to significantly penetrate thus far. In the almost 20 years since the 1992 World Earth Summit, the Kyoto Protocol and COP-15 Copenhagen meeting of 2009 have both been well-intentioned but ineffectual in the eyes of many, failing to produce the change they hoped for. Throughout the history of energy, the exaggerations are rife and the under-performance standard. Such recurring disappointments of strategies and proposals suggest a critical review of energy futures is overdue and an examination of the “energy crisis” and its responses is needed if this pattern is not to continue.
- Why energy?-6
- Climate change mitigation by carbon emission reduction, energy security and economic growth are currently seen as the dominant competing and oft-conflicting foci of energy discussion. However they are not equally, nor universally, held to be the primary challenges. The “energy crisis” is seen in different ways by many stakeholders, each according differing degrees of importance to the many sectors, actors and effects. Similar perspectives can spawn opposed responses while, conversely, opposing perspectives may promote similar means. The differences often escalate to make the arena quite ferocious and move from being “debate” to a “battle” for supremacy, often in the guise of “sustainability” or “growth”.

- Lack of previous work
- Lack of previous work   As briefly mentioned in section 1.2.1.2, an initial review of some energy futures literature indicates much futures work has been done though it is to be of a relatively limited nature. The limitations refer to the typologies of futures produced, determined by the methodologies employed. These are commonly forecasts and scenarios produced via economic, technological and/or climatic modelling. The associated visions, foundational assumptions or worldviews that are inherent in forecasts and scenarios are rarely rigorously analysed, developed or even articulated and acknowledged.  Similarly, particular energy issues are often treated in isolation based on the preferences of the stakeholder, or purely out of innocent ignorance or inability. Rarely are more than two or three drivers of energy futures situated together for comparison, contrast and combined futuring. Energy futuring has focused on certain things  Technology pathways and development Salvation by technology Forecasts and scenarios Received/passive futures Favoured structure, rather than agency Climate change Oil supply  No map exists Mention CSIRO, “The Heat is On” as the closest known to the author   Energy work hasn’t used futures much Transformative futures work hasn’t looked at energy much  Much questioning of solutions. But is there much questioning of the problem?  Agency has been lost! Dominated by forecasts!!  (Summary of Section 1.2.1) For a safe, secure, clean, prosperous, efficient energy system to become a reality begin to work now and in the future, we must first identify the energy futures we hold in the present. No adequate map currently exists of global energy futures locating the full array of stakeholders’ visions and strategies, as well as the drivers of their energy futures, that doesn’t simplistically reduce the richness of perspectives and array of alternatives. The growing database of models, forecasts and scenarios remain to be critiqued, using a toolbox of deep, transformative futures methodologies that have not been applied to energy as a whole, offering genuinely alternative pathways.  The need for the evolution of energy futuring methods mirrors developments around energy resources, technology and policy. We must identify the spectrum of futures that exist, aEnergy resources exist in various forms in various locations. This variety calls for an assortment of technologies to discover, evaluate, exploit, distribute and utilise them. The nature and knowledge of these sources, forms, tools and models has expanded and evolved over history. There is widespread difference of opinion on energy challenges and solutions but two of the things that are generally agreed upon are a) that there should be a greater mix of energy sources – a portfolio of solutions, and b) that we must use energy more wisely.  And so it must be with energy futures and energy futuring. This work hopes to identify and locate a broader pool of energy futures resources and evaluate them using previously untried methods. Subsequently, innovative techniques need be employed, in addition to traditional methods, to utilize new futures resources while extracting novel alternative product from conventional resources. A portfolio of genuinely alternative energy futures generated from a toolbox of energy futuring instruments creates the possibility for more robust, wiser energy policy.

- Physical energy (chemical, electrical, mechanical etc) is central to physical existence. Human development has, in part, been facilitated by increasingly intense energy usage. Alternatively, human development has seen increasingly intense energy usage result. Either way, the world is presently in a situation where the nature of this energy usage to this present time has potentially jeopardised and/or retarded further human development, as its been traditionally viewed. There is a strong link between social unrest and the quality of access to material resources, including energy. The threats posed by this and climate change as a result of our dominant energy systems and the mentalities behind them are present on a scale of previously unencountered extensiveness and degrees of severity.
- For the world-2
- Therefore, brought into the spotlight are the questions a) “What constitutes human development”? and b) “What energy systems can best facilitate that?” These questions are not new. Alone, each question has been asked at length. Together, in the same analysis, the asking has been less frequent. To a depth where conventional, orthodox notions of each have been transcended, I think these questions have rarely been combined.
- For the world-3
- In a nutshell, I see the forum of energy as a way of illustrating the fundamental spiritual nature of material resource issues. Neglect of spiritual considerations in the addressing of energy related matters will result in short-term fixes at best, often resulting in longer-term malaise. Addressing energy, and other material resource issues, provides the forum for spiritual, and thus fundamental human, development.
- For the world-4
- As an Australian, the choice of Australia as my sample is expected. However, as a primary energy producer with a society that is very energy intensive in a rapidly changing world, the importance of well-crafted energy policy and foresight can't be overstated. Furthermore, in contrast to many other primary energy producers and energy intensive nations of the world, Australia has the material wealth, levels of well-being and sufficient social development to successfully navigate into a better energy future, and perhaps blaze a trail for others to emulate.

- I want to understand the world better.
- I see energy as a useful metaphor or link to understand diverse aspects of the world.
- I want to feel like I'm making a difference.
- Energy is universal and fundamental, as is technology. Having an influence in these fields may help the world somewhat.
- For me
- The significance of this research question is many-fold. I am interested in practically realizing far-reaching positive change in the world. Physical energy is a central and universal issue of fundamental importance and thus provides a forum for this. My academic background is in engineering so it seems an appropriate choice of issue.  However, In pursuing my engineering education the focus of my questioning moved from a technical “how?” to a social “what for?”. I had been involved in military-oriented research and this shift prompted a desire to a) move to a benign, peace-oriented field, and b) approach it from less of a purely technical perspective and more from a socio-economic point of view. I was drawn to the issues of sustainable energy policy for the chance to make a contribution to peace working more directly with the human aspect than the gadgetry. A big influence in this research was my meeting Dr Brian O'Leary. He is a former NASA astrophysicist-astronaut who now campaigns for “new energy”. “New energy” is a broad term covering technical devices and the science around them which test the limits of scientific orthodoxy. He, amongst others, has documented devices around the world which seem to generate heat and/or electricity in a way that contravenes scientific “law”. The most prominent of these might be the “cold fusion” episode. According to Dr O'Leary and a number of other reputable scholars, there exist these technologies, admittedly in a rudimentary stage, awaiting further development for application to alleviate many of the world's energy-related problems. However, as might be expected, there is resistance to their acceptance from various factions.  I am open to the possibilities of “new energy” having been given persuasive arguments and credible evidence, despite the existence of charlatans and fraudsters within the field. I would like to see these technologies introduced on a wide-scale in the world and so I am interested in addressing the barriers to their acceptance and promulgation, and thus the barriers to any “better” energy systems generally.

- Personal interest
- Personal interest to the author.  Novelty. A cursory survey of literature reveals energy futures are already routinely addressed via economic, mathematic, engineering, geologic, ecologic and similar techno-economic and system science approaches. To the best of the author’s knowledge, there remains the need to adequately complement these useful techniques with approaches beyond hard science methods and mindsets.

- Energy-consciousness spectrum idea
- Use the energy spectrum metaphor, equating energy to consciousness. The energy policy stuff has to fit in to the ladder. That is, spiritual/consciousness development can be fitted to a wholistic energy spectrum model. The Wilber and SD's et al tiers of consciousness, Hawkins calibration scale can be modelled in energy terms.
- Energy spectrum ladder
- Placing physical energy in its proper place in the energy spectrum. That is... the material is currently seen as the source of life. This is arse-about. It needs to go in its rightful place, “down the ladder” in order of importance and life-giving ability. I imagine there could be various levels of subtle energy, which gives rise to physical energy. Within the range of physical energy, there is a sub-spectrum too: Tachyon to our detectable emf down to dense material.
- Subtle energy development
- An ideal conventional energy scenario realization requires subtle energy development. Idea of “energy” must be expanded to include “subtle” energy development (ie. Spiritual development) Conventional energy policy/scenario forecasting must include “subtle energy policy” Better/ideal energy policy creation and realization requires consciousness development.

- Energy “debate” is, more accurately, energy “conflict”
- Energy “debate” is, more accurately, energy “conflict”.  As such, conflict resolution skills may be equally helpful, and possibly in greater need now, rather than sole focus on scientific proficiency, economic planning or political gamesmanship.
-
- The energy “debate” is, more accurately, energy “conflict”.   Debate and dialogue around energy futures has increasingly become war-like, or even war itself in some cases, as the potential effects of energy systems are explored, understood or unfold. Armed conflict driven by control of resources, venomous political argument, angry social demonstration, heated dinner discussion and vitriolic blog commentary testify to less genuine debate and moreso to battle.   Technical reasoning alone, in such cases, is insufficient and ineffective as a solution to the conflict. In fact, it may be part of the problem. As such, conflict resolution skills and relationship building may be equally helpful, and possibly in greater need now, rather than a primary focus on scientific proficiency, economic planning or political gamesmanship.
- Conflict and the effectiveness of energy futures
- The world faces unprecedented challenges centred around its energy system.
- Novel approaches are required to come up with out-of-the box solutions to non-traditional energy crises.
- Numerous scenarios and visions of that energy future already exist and give birth to conflicting policies and strategies.
- Energy stakeholders are effectively in conflict. This conflict reduces the effectiveness of each and every stakeholder and their vision.
- This delay and sub-optimal use of resources (time, money, energy) exacerbates the original problems.
- Alignment of energy futures scope, scale and processes
- Dominant energy futuring processes do not agree with the range of impact of energy. The nature and scope of dominant energy futuring processes, energy futures content, energy system characteristics and energy usage consequences do not align coherently with each other. This is inefficient, ineffective and creates further problems rather than resolving them.
-
- Each of these four elements need to be aligned for more effective futures and policy. The energy system touches people fundamentally, playing a critical role in quality of life. The full extent that energy system interacts with its surroundings, as well as itself, must be well understood and contained within energy futures and policy. This complexity and richness should be reflected in the processes and tools used to envision, plan and make decisions.
-
- The degree to which this is done within current energy futures varies, with dominant energy futures considering only a limited range of energetic interactions, viewing society and environment primarily as mathematically modellable entitites. The full spectrum of the immeasurable and intangible human experience and natural value in the energetic environment is rarely considered in energy futures.   Exclusion or devaluation of this creates problems (e.g. environmental externalities and social dislocation).
-
- It is hypothesised that aligning energy futures techniques and content with the reach and extent of the energy system will enhance energy futures and policy. Its not energy that we want. What we want is what energy provides, enables or produces. Which energy services predominate in society, and how, reflect social values, norms, customs, culture and worldviews as much as technological availability. However, energy policy formulation and futuring generally ignore this, favouring “value-free” mechanical mathematical economic modelling and forecasts. Social and future dimensions of energy policy are an after-thought or, at best, an opinion poll.
- Typical energy futures are narrow
- Do not include considerations of:
- bio-physical economics
- money as a representation of stored energy
- end purpose of energy
-
- Energy as leverage point for grand solutions
- Energy being central and fundamental… if we address this one central question, we can resolve many resulting problems. Yet, we must go further and address the underlying problem(s) of energy futuring being narrow and shallow.
- Energy as symbol and metaphor
-
-
- The symbology and metaphor of energy and energy systems is undervalued and under-utilised.  Energy underpins and characterises both economy and ecology. As the economy is symbolic and a representative indicator of society, the energy system, energy policy and energy futures are therefore symbolic of society.
-
- Thus, how the transformation of the energy system occurs correlates with economic and ecological health and development.
-
- The stories, symbols, myths and metaphors we hold about energy play out in the material world, yet they are often not questioned in energy futuring, and technical and social analysis generally.  Identifying the energy stories we live by, and the energy images we hold dear, are critical pillars in the effort to create robust, prosperous energy systems.
-
- Critical futures approaches openly acknowledge symbology and myth (deep narrative) and are therefore ideally suited to this analysis.
- Layers of reality. Layers of barriers to preferred energy future.
- Economics nor technological lack not the real barriers. The issues are fundamentally  psycho-spiritual. Imagination and belief.
-
- When we disagree on technology and policy choices, is that the full extent of the disagreement? Are we disagreeing on something else, perhaps something deeper?

- The concept of “energy crisis” needs illumination.
- The term “energy crisis” needs clarification. There is a crisis and yes, it does involve energy. But it is not for a lack of oil, gas, solar radiation, wind or hydrogen. It is not for a lack of money or other physical materials.
-
- The concept of  “energy crisis” needs illumination.   The “energy crisis” is defined, perceived and seen in many different ways by many different groups. The energy challenge is framed differently as drivers and goals are prioritised differently. These differing perception sences can cause inefficiencies and conflict but can also be optimised and leveraged for mutual benefit resolved. Understanding how different stakeholder define the “energy crisis”, and how it has evolved over time, is paramount to achieve this.

- a. The “energy crisis” is defined and seen in many different ways by many different groups. These differences can cause conflict but can also be resolved.
- b. The energy “crisis” is not fundamentally a crisis of energy, per se. At its core, its not a problem of:  Energy supply (inadequate, insufficient, unreliable)  Energy demand (excessive)  Energy efficiency  Technology availability  Economic unattractiveness or financial lack  Social disruption or environmental devastation (symptom)  Insufficient political will  These phenomena are certainly challenges and addressing them is essential. However, it is hypothesised that the crisis in energy lies in  a) The foundational ideas underlying energy thinking (science, economics, planning, culture b) An unwillingness and resistance in exploring these conceptual underpinnings.

-
- This is an exercise in exploring problem re-definition, organisational transformation, and inter-stakeholder team relationship-building, conflict resolution, creating shared common visions and working towards them together unified action as much as it has been about techno-economic innovation and political manoeuvring, yet it is the latter two which have been privileged and over-emphasised..
-
- To implement plans to realising better futures, our psycho-spiritual nature must be  consciously and directly engaged. We must do our spiritual homework.
- Assertion: Understanding of the problem does not exist
- Understanding of the problem doesn’t seem to exist. If it did then the solution would already have been implemented. Alternatively, it isn’t applied, wherein lies the problem.
-
- There are layers to the problem. Each energy future limits its analysis to a certain layer.
-
-
- We need alternative energy futures
- Energy futures not just about developing new/advanced energy technologies and more complex models but energy futuring technologies
- Just as technologies develop to harness power and generate electricity, so too can the tools of energy futuring and policy creation be advanced to harness creativity and co-operation and generate inspiration.
-
- An energy policy framework and futuring process is available for creation/discovery which will stand in better stead than current models and processes

- Cause – effect confusion
- The common thinking is we must transform and develop our energy system for a peaceful, prosperous future. This work contends that we must transform our energy future in order to have a peaceful, prosperous socio-ecological system.  The transformation of the energy system to achieve sustainable development, economic growth, prosperity, or whatever other lofty aim, will only come as a result of the transformation of the selves who envision, plan, strategize and communicate. There is undoubtedly a mutual iterative feedback relationship between energy system change and changes in quality of life. Generally, though, we are more heavily invested in external energy system change without investigating the selves who attempt to enact it.  Energy futures do not generally advocate personal and inter-personal transformative practice as a tool. Due to this backwards reasoning of placing effect as cause and cause as effect, energy futures are inefficient according to their proclaimed objectives.
-
- The transformation of the energy system to achieve sustainable development will only come as a result of the transformation of our selves. Currently, and generally, we are attempting to reverse this process. By attempting to transform the energy system, we are hoping to transform society and thus, ultimately, our personal lives. Due to this backwards reasoning, energy futures are ineffectual, placing effect as cause and cause as effect. Transform the inner to transform the outer, rather than the other way around. A transformed energy system will bring a transformed social system (including economic system) and eco-system. But a transformed social system requires the inner transformation of society, or rather the inner transformation of selves. The process of transforming (cv. changing) the energy system towards a preferred future is the process of transforming the self.  Those seeking alternative energy futures do not generally understand this and continue to embody conventional thought patterns, resulting perhaps in superficially different systems that are fundamentally identical.
	- The process of transforming the energy system as the means of social development rather than a transformed energy system causing social/sustainable development. Changing (transforming) the energy system so that we can have “sustainable development” IS, in itself, the development. The change in practices, philosophies and methods, in planning and in carrying out the plans, is the development, rather than what goes on after the crisis is solved. It is the transformation, not the development that occurs afterwards.
-
- Energy is seen as the means of “development”. Yet it is the transformation of the energy system which is the development itself. If we can address energy system transformation fully, then the ensuing “development” is “sustainable” (or whatever characteristic) as a result of the nature of the energy system (or whatever system). It is the mindsets and consciousness of agents which have been transformed (or “released”), thus outlining the course of pathways from there. (Outer reflection of an inner condition. Transformation is of the inner condition.)
-
- Similarly, wrt climate change. The climate change-energy/resource usage nexus is exactly the means by which human development can occur. Answering the question(s) is where the development occurs, not once the question is answered.I think the current view is “let's sort out the energy and water problems so we can grow and develop”. However, i reckon its now “we grow and develop BY sorting out the energy and water problems” If we incorporated inner dimensions (inner development) to energy futures then perhaps we wouldn’t have a repeat of climate change and/or peak oil threats. The real goal is inner development. Climate Change – Culture Change. There is a culture change because of climate change. Perhaps climate change could have been avoided or reduced because of a culture change.
- Development chicken-egg
- The climate change-energy/resource usage nexus is exactly the means by which human development can occur.  Answering the question(s) is where the development occurs, not once the question is answered. I think the current view is “let's sort out the energy and water problems so we can grow and develop”. However, i reckon its now “we grow and develop BY sorting out the energy and water problems”
- Energy's Role in Social Development
- We set our goals in society, industry etc THEN design the energy system to get these. Can we design our energy system first which then determines our goals in society, industry?
-
- In designing our energy system we are expressing our values, beliefs and attitudes. Perhaps we need to approach this solution from both ends... ie
- 1. Determine the goals of society/industry/business and from that determine the energy and resource requirements
- 2. Determine the possible theoretical energy production (according to certains sets of values, beliefs, attitudes, criteria eg. If only renewables, if only fossil fuels etc etc) and from that determine our social goals.
-
- Energy Technology Innovation – The Energy-Social Development Chicken-Egg cycle
- How has the energy technology at any one place and time tied in with the social development there? What/which is driving/leading, and how? Do they take turns, iteratively spurring off one another?
-
- Discovering/harnessing fire/firewood and animals lead to social developments. These social developments then allowed the next phase of energy technology to be discovered/invented/harnessed. (What was that?) A cyclic process underway?
-
- Energy technology ties in intimately with the other technology around it. Probably can’t do an energy macrohistory or energy tech trend identification without doing an overall tech one simultaneously.  Information production and distribution and its energy supply - Printing press, Internet  Transport  Food, agriculture  Housing, heating  Creativity – arts, science, philosophy... activities beyond basic necessities of the day
-
- Is there a shift that needs to be made, in the following sense: We create and structure an energy system that fits our goals in the world. We want to build this, run that, travel there...so we set up the energy system that supports that. We do what it takes to set up that energy system.
-
- Now, instead, our energy system may need to EMBODY, and be a direct expression, of our goals in the world. [Coherence!!] This is almost like a retraction of our source of [true, inner]power being from outside [of the energy system] to within it. The values evident within the energy system were separate and distinct from the values of the goals we were trying to achieve. Now, at this time, perhaps this internalization needs to occur...?!?!
-
- Is our energy system already an expression of our values? I think so. Is it already an expression of our thoughts about ourselves? Perhaps need to consider energy’s role in contributing to levels of social satisfaction. Eg. More energy/fuel used to make more and more stuff which satisfies less and less.
-
- PERHAPS NOW WE NEED TO BE DRIVEN BY POSSIBILITY RATHER THAN REACTING TO THREAT!!! Ie. Shift the driver of social change from response to threat and lack to one of fostering, promoting, encouraging, fomenting POSSIBILITY (of peace, prosperity, security).
- What possibility can we envision for the world with regards to its energy system. What are the possibilities that the[new] energy system is opening up and allowing to be possible?
- In RESPONDING to climate change/global warming, peak oil, energy security issues, we can shift from being reactive to proactive. Let’s NOT ONLY respond to these issues powerfully, but go FURTHER to be drawn further into the future by our INSPIRED VISION.
-
- Energy System’s Purpose?
- What does each party think the purpose of the energy system is? What are we providing energy FOR? What are the varying views? Is it REALLY for what we think its for? Can we come up with another purpose that will unite? Is the purpose of the energy system actually to UNITE!?!?! To promote a sense of UNITY! A feeling of oneness, unity, team, cohesion? Wow. What an idea! Feels good.  What are the symbolic metaphors each party has of energy and energy system’s evolution?
- Energy futures are a driver of social development, or not.
- Energy futures are a driver of social development, or not.   Development of any kind requires energy. The quantity and quality of energy available (in the sense of characteristics as well as excellence), determine how organisations and ecosystems grow, and by how much. Therefore, energy futures correlate closely with  general futures. Broad future visions contain particular energy futures. In other words, competition between energy futures is competition between broader, general futures.  With a suitable energy vision and accompanying comprehensive strategy which inspires people, society and industry, the energy system could become a driver of grand dreams and mechanism of meaning. In the modern industrial age, characterized by technological energy developments, energy policy has largely been an afterthought in an uninspired quest for ultimately empty mirages of power and trinkets.

- Energy policy and energy futures may be leverage point for grand solutions
- Energy being central… if we address this one central question, we can resolve many resulting problems. Yet, we must go further and address the underlying problem(s) of energy (see point 1
-
- Energy policy and energy futures may be  leverage point for grand solutions  Energy being centralBeing fundamental, central and universal to all life and social endeavours, … if effective energy policy is developed to produce safe, clean, secure, reliable, prosperous and efficient energy systems, then we may concurrently resolve seemingly separate problems. This is not an attempt to proclaim energy as the most important issue, rather to emphasise the inter-relatedness of problem structures.  we address this one central question, we can resolve many resulting problems. Yet, we must go further and address the underlying problem(s) of energy (see point 1
- An exercise in conflict resolution
- Conflict Resolution v Sci-tech-econ-politics??
-
- Internal intra-stakeholder conflict (within an organisation), internal infra-stakeholder conflict (within oneself) as well as external inter-stakeholder conflict.
-
- {old}
- Is “Australia’s Energy Future” issues are more about conflict resolution and mediating competing interests than technology, economics and politics?? Is this more about tempering competing visions of the future and uniting them? Could this be more about altering/modifying visions of the future so that competing visions mesh together and unite, resulting in cohesive harmonic effort? Could this be about helping others and facilitating others in expanding their visions of the future – what’s possible and how it can be possible – so that each and every one can see how we’re on the same team?  An effective solution will require co-operation, coherence and unity.
-
- This is an exercise in team-building, uniting, conflict resolution, creating shared common visions and working towards them together. The technicalities of the issue mask these fundamental points.
- External barriers to preferred energy future same as internal barriers to preferred future
- The barriers and obstacles to preferred energy futures are the same barriers and obstacles that each stakeholder faces in their own personal/organisational lives. Cynicism? Lack of vision?  lack of willingness to...? • challenge one's beliefs in the face of suffering • consider alternatives which challenge the comfort zone • challenge one's idea of Self
- Summary of inter-connected hypotheses and contentions
- The various inter-related hypotheses and ideas in the various ways I’ve expressed them.
- 1. This is a problem within the field of energy but its not a problem OF energy.
- 2. Each vision/strategy/approach has a piece of the puzzle. Each is partially “correct”.
- 3. Each approach is lacking some key ingredient which prevents it from being rapidly and smoothly implemented, right across the board
- 4. The puzzle may be lacking other pieces. There is lacking an overall “umbrella factor”, “glue” – an integrator
- 5. The missing ingredient in each is the same or similar in essence, though perhaps in a slightly different form.
- 6. With a suitable Energy Vision which inspires people, society and industry into action, the energy system can become a driver of dreams, and not just an afterthought to achieve dreams. There are as yet unrealized potential benefits in deliberately driving the transition to an energy future rather than manipulating or managing the current juggernaut’s path.
- 7. In essence, under superficial differences, the obstacles each stakeholder faces in realizing their vision of Australia’s Energy Future are the same obstacles each stakeholder faces in their own personal lives.
- 8. An(other) inspiring vision of the energy future can be invented which will accelerate stakeholders to take complementary coherent action.

-
- There must be a dominant, overarching, top-prioritized location structure
- My idea is that there exist multiple frameworks and taxonomies through which data could be categorized. This is good, philosophically and academically, but potentially presents problems from a URL point of view. What is topic/sub-topic/sub-sub-topic/… structure? You can’t have multiple - there can be only 1 unique URL.
-
- Articles may be accessed via other menu structures but they must have the URL address of the top-schema
- Webwiki v2.0 specifications
- Posts should be able to draw data from external sources, visualize it and reference it.
- There may not be any need for extra comment. Just showing the graph is useful.
- Easy form to enter "energy futures instances".
- This form should have a set of adjustable fields which can be modified, updated, added to as different taxonomies and frameworks become apparent.
- Remember, each energy future instant can occupy different places/spaces under different models. Each organization could be positioned a differently according to different criteria schema etc.
- Does this require the use of graph database tech? Ontology software?
- This field adjustment has to happen in the back-end, i think.
- Blogroll/RSS feeds of interesting sites
- Note, these aren’t necessarily the “regulars” eg. Greenpeace, Shell etc.
-
- This will be a roll of critical analysts on “higher” ie overviewing, overarching energy issues
- Global Effort twitter feed visible
- Grow to establish a community
- Scalable database
- Grow to have pay-for-access parts
- Readability
- Columns can’t be too wide
- Folded reading
- Folded writing/reading
- Not only folded/drop-down reading, going to multiple (unspecified) levels BUT…
-
- Folded writing, also.
- That is, in the back-end, being able to write in this mode. ie. Write
- Title
- Headings 1 (primary points)
- Headings 2 (primary point expansion = second level detail)
- Headings 3 (secondary point expansion)

-
- Optical media slow down the speed of light. They refract it, like a lens.
-
- Perhaps there is a \"lens\" that \"bends\" light, altering its speed, and therefore space-time

- Relate relativity, space-time, speed of light, time travel

- We are in or looking through a lens which changes how we perceive the universe.

- Models of Reality
- Models of Reality
-
- Our models of reality reflect our own technologies and systems, themselves a representation of the mind conceiving them. These are all conceptions of the separated ego mind.
-
- First, man makes or sees an image or object. Then man, being pleased with his invention, makes an idol of worship out of this image. Then man says reality is like this invented image.
-
- There has been an evolution of these images and objects. Animals. Agriculture. Mechanics. Computation. Holographics.
-
- Key in this process is the collective nature of it, and the forgetting of certain steps.
-
- When we create advanced technologies, is that just a remembering of more of the whole mind? After all, The new tech system is capable of more than the previous system.

- Energy Futures instances
- Particular scenario, pathways, forecasts, models, predictions et al made by individuals and organisations
- PRIMARY FOCUS of the document is on reporting and detailing the futures.
- Naturally, how these futures are arrived will probably be discussed or mentioned, but its not at great length or detail.
- Includes technology assessments
-
- Energy, General
- General issues in and around Energy
- Primers, overviews,
- Some futures may be presented but energy futures instances are NOT PRIMARY FOCUS
- eg.
- Energy nexus futures & issues
- Food and Water are big ones
-
- Energy Futuring methodologies
- PRIMARY FOCUS is on methodology.
- That is, most of the article is an explanation of a method, or a critique of a future using a method (an applied case)

- Universal Energy Relationship
- On the need for a hierarchical energy relationship
-
- We need to relate labour, food, gross energy, oil etc to higher order forms of energy:
- money
- inner satisfaction and experience
-
-
- Reindeer herders in Kamchatka; subsistence farmers
- Don't want to become reindeer
-
- Everyone wants increasing EROEI
- To do more with less
- To get more by giving less
-
-
- Beyond a certain value, increased consumption of a particular level's form of energy introduces negative energy return...
- and perhaps negative energy return on another level
- reflects negative/low energy values on higher levels eg. eating disorder, monetary greed

- Relating to the chicken-egg idea of decide the (socio-economic) outcomes we want, then design the energy/tech systems to achieve this, OR… We have the energy/tech systems first, which determine the socio-economic systems we have.
- Historical analysis of the energy systems of particular socio-economic systems & structures
- Feudalism

-
- How does the energy supply and distribution enable, facilitate, reinforce, create the broader socio-economic system?
- And vice-versa. How does the socio-economic ideology determine the energy system?
