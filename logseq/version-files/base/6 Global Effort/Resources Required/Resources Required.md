Do you see the energy problem as being much bigger than technology or policy?
Do you think that different groups define the ‘energy problem’ differently?
Do you believe no ‘one’ has the answer, and no one is entirely wrong?
Do you have a basic appreciation of models of science, economics, politics, anthropology, psychology…as well as recognise their shortcomings?
Do you want to get involved?
If so, please email me.
