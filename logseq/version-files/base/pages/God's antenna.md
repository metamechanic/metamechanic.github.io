- got out of the pool this afternoon, looked up at the roof and the thought hit me: "just be an antenna (for God)"
- Antenna was just there, doing nothing
	- "I need do nothing."
- Receiving the message, and passing it on
- To be a good antenna, one must remove the noise, the static; one must be tuned, attuned, to the right frequency
- see ACIM for section on "God's messengers"
	- the message is first for the messenger
