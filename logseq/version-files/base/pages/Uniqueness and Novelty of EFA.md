	- Targeting effective triggers and solutions through a logical sequence of (in)sufficiency investigation
	- The Enough For All story structure follows a logical if-then questioning route to uncover problems, data, answers and supposed answers.  This way readers can discover  1. Issues and data,   2. attempts at addressing the issue,   3. assumptions and limitations in the data,   4. the layers and perspectives on the issue and its solutions  5. Linkages between complex issues and attempted solutions, and  6. Target trigger points for effective action  An important part of Enough For All is that readers can offer and inject insights and data into the pathway-network, keeping in mind that entry will be scrutinised by the community for novelty, uniqueness, overlap, pre-existence etc. The success of Enough For All relies on this very process.
