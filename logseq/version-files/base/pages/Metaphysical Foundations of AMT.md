sub-title:: Propositions, postulates, premises and principles of AMT

- [[The More-ganism]]
- The one real problem – a sense of separation from Source.
- Projection vs Extension
- Creation & Miscreation
- God
  collapsed:: true
	- Define "define"
	  collapsed:: true
		- Undefining God
		- Universal characteristics of God
	- [[God, "God", god and gods]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Attributes of God; defining "God", "god", "gods"
			- Strawman arguments
				- defining God in a weak way, or subscribing to a weak definition, in opposition, is a cop out.
			- [[Aristotle]]
			- [[St Augustine]]
			- [[Thomas Aquinas]]
			- [[St Anselm]]
			- Need to contrast these with Eastern traditions, indigenous, other faiths
			- Commonly ascribed characteristics of God
				- Creator (of the world/universe)
				- Judge
	- ‘Spiritual’, ‘spiritual’, ’Self’, ‘self’ and ‘sacred’
	  collapsed:: true
		- Spirit is whole and complete, perfect and lacking nothing, ever changeless, ever loving.
		- ‘Spiritual’ pertains to Spirit.
		- ’spiritual’ reflects one’s idea of one’s self. Everyone is spiritual. Everything is spiritual, because it reflects one’s ideas of oneself.
	- God’s creations are limitless and pure, perfect love. God created Heaven. The ego created the universe of form, time & space.
	- God is completely benign.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Total benignity is a very difficult concept to appreciate.
		- God created You. And God only creates perfectly. God created You perfect, pure, sinless and totally worthy of love. He knows You better than You do. He knows you to be perfect. Therefore, there is nothing really in You that requires forgiveness of God.
	- Everyone believes in God. But not everyone believes in their definition of “God”.
	- [[Everything except God is metaphor]]
- The world. The Universe.
  collapsed:: true
	- The world/universe was created as an escape from guilt, fear & punishment.
	- The world is made as a defence and distraction
	- The universe is a closed-loop system. The universe of form/separation/space-time is designed to reinforce itself as true and real.
	- Levels
	- Layers (of the egonion)
	- The universe is the ego’s attempt to imitate/replicate Heaven.
	- Worldly problems are the ego’s distraction tactic from the one real problem – a sense of separation from Source. This idea is the very ego itself, so worldly problems are the ego’s survival mechanism.
	- God did not create the Universe.
	  collapsed:: true
		- There is an intelligence which designed and created the Universe, but it is not God.
		- No really intelligent designer would make this world. This unIntelligent Designer, however, while being the creator of pattern and fallibility and weakness is the same generator of randomness and pattern being broken. "Seek and do not find." - the metapattern
	- [[Everything except God is metaphor]]
	- The world of form – the universe of time & space – is like a holographic dream.
	  collapsed:: true
		- An image
		- An illusion
		- A dream
		- An optical delusion
		- A hologram
		- A projection
	- Yet it is the nature of the ego to separate and fragment. Thus the world of multiplicity.
	- The world is a place to hide.
	- The world is designed not to work.
	-
- The body and bodies in general
  collapsed:: true
	- God is dead...
	  collapsed:: true
		- and you killed Him
		- Nietzsche
	- sacrifice; cannibalization
	- I exist, and its your fault
	- Brain and heart as "signal receivers" or "signal detectors" rather than "signal generators"
		-
	- Bodies are the home/palace of the ego. The ego seeks to make idols out of bodies.
	- The body, and its senses, are designed to attest to the reality of the universe of form and separation.
		- ##### W-pI.64.1
		  Today’s idea is merely another way of saying “Let me not wander into temptation.” ²The purpose of the world you see is to obscure your function of forgiveness, and provide you with a justification for forgetting it. ³It is the temptation to abandon God and His Son by taking on a physical appearance. ⁴It is this the body’s eyes look upon.
- The mind, and Mind.
  collapsed:: true
	- resistance
	- the purpose of memory
	- unconscious, and its role
		- the locus of the lie
	- ideas leave not their source
	- Paradox
	- Consciousness as shiny toy, as idol
	- Consciousness is not of God.
		- it has levels, aspects, degrees.... variation
	- There is no such thing as faithlessness.
		- Atheists don't believe in a certain definition of "God". Everyone believes in God. There is no such thing as atheism.
	- No Theory of Everything, since it is designed on malfunction, separation, fragmentation
	- Repeated Sleight of hand, combined with amnesia.
	- The world is designed to look like it works, like its a nice place at times... Then the rug is pulled out, the facade is ripped off.
	- The world is designed as a distraction from looking at the source of the problem. Daily life, with its problems and dramas, is designed to distract from the underlying, real problem.
	- Beliefs don’t make Reality or Truth but they do make the appearance of it, and the experience of it.
	- All thinking is circular. At our deepest level, we are always proving our premise. However, some part of the circle may have been ‘conveniently’ forgotten to absolve ourselves of responsibility.
	- Level of mind vs level of behaviour/world
	- [[Sin, guilt, fear & punishment]]
		- Anger, doubt, jealousy, confusion, hatred, cynicism, boredom, apathy…are all masks of fear. Fear arises from a sense of guilt because a sense of guilt calls for punishment. Therefore surface fears are the tip of the iceberg of the deeper fear of punishment from God.
	- The tiny, mad idea vs the belief in the tiny, mad idea
	- the body-mind and the right-mind
	- [[The Unholy Trinity - Sin, Guilt and Fear]]
- The ego. The devil.
  collapsed:: true
	- [[self-referencing]]
		- The ego is something like [[Maurits Cornell Escher]]'s drawings:
			- it is a labyrinth of itself, not wanting you to escape
			- it is its own Creator ? or wants to portray itself that way, as God
				- the hand that draws itself; that creates God in its own image
			- the staircase drawing of Escher
				- you keep going up and down stairs, not realizing you're going around in circles
			- The ego only sees itself
				- Was this Freud's problem? He saw no way out of this predicament?
				- "A bad thing does not exist"
				- "It obliterates the question." The sense that there is something beyond it. The question "what am I/are we running away from?"
			- It is the right-mind (or is it?) that sees a way-out, or sees that there is an alternative, that "beyond this there is a world I want"
	- one or the other; kill or be killed
	- The ego created the universe of form, time & space.
	- The ego wants to be God
	- The ego wants to be God.
	- All powerful. Makes a universe.
	- The Intelligent (Evil) Designer
	- The ego is perfectly logical.
		- But all logic is built on the premise, the foundational idea.
	- One ego appearing as many
- Form vs Content
  collapsed:: true
	- The form is changed to preserve the content, rather than change the content to preserve the form.
- the double shield of oblivion
- Purpose is everything; What is it for?
