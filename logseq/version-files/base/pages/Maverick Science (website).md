- We hold these truths to be self-evident:
	- The first gods were the planets, pure and simple.
	- Myths of Creation are best understood as eye-witness accounts describing singular cataclysmic events involving the respective planets moving in close proximity to Earth.
	- The earliest cosmogonic myths of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Vedic India, and Mesoamerica encode the “birth” of the Turquoise Sun, a Sun which is clearly distinguishable from the present sun.
	- The Queen of Heaven referenced in the Old Testament and in countless other ancient traditions around the globe is to be identified with the planet Venus.
	- The Warrior-Hero—represented by such familiar figures as Heracles, Gilgamesh, Samson, and Cuchulainn—is to be identified with the planet Mars.
	- The global myth of the *hieros gamos*, most familiar in Homer’s account of the torrid love affair between Aphrodite and Ares, describes a close conjunction (“marriage”) between Venus and Mars.
	- The origin of the primary institutions of human civilization—religion, drama, dance, music, philosophy, monumental architecture, New Year’s ritual, marriage, sports, etc.—is firmly rooted in, and ultimately inseparable from, the catastrophic events involving the respective planets.
	- The history of the solar system recounted in modern textbooks is utterly wrongheaded and divorced from reality.
