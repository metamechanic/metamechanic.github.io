	- ## About
	  
	  Brilliant people shaping our world. 
	  
	  Hi, I'm Cindy Pom, and before starting Newsthink, I worked as an international correspondent in Paris and London, contributing to CBS News and Canada's CBC News, CTV News, and Global News. But I wanted to tell in-depth stories that aren't always given the attention they deserve in traditional news outlets. So, I decided to go independent.
	  
	  Thanks for joining me on this journey of discovery!
