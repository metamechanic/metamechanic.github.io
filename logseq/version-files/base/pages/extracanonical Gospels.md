	- Extracanonical gospels and apocrypha both refer to writings about Jesus and early Christian teachings that are not included in the New Testament canon. However, they differ in their scope and usage:
	- **Extracanonical Writings**: These include a broader range of texts from early Christian communities that were not included in the New Testament canon. They are valuable for understanding the diversity of early Christian beliefs and practices. Examples include the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Peter, and the Gospel of Judas. These texts are often studied by scholars to gain insights into the development of early Christianity.
	- **Apocrypha**: This term specifically refers to texts that were excluded from the canon but were sometimes used by early Christians and are considered useful for historical and theological study. In the context of the New Testament, apocryphal texts are often pseudepigrapha, meaning they were falsely attributed to an apostle or early Christian figure. Examples include the Gospel of Peter and the Gospel of Thomas. These texts are not considered authoritative or inspired by mainstream Christian denominations. In summary, while both extracanonical and apocryphal texts are outside the New Testament canon and provide insights into early Christian thought, the term “apocrypha” often carries a connotation of being falsely attributed, whereas “extracanonical” is a broader term that includes a wider range of texts from early Christian communities.

	- ### Are “Extracanonical” Writings the Same as  ***The Apocrypha*** ?
	  
	  No. *The Apocrypha* is a term mostly used by Protestants. Roman Catholics use the term *Deuterocanonical* (second canon). Both terms refer to books that are included in the Greek translation of what Christians call the “Old Testament” known as the [[Septuagint]] . They are not included in the Hebrew version, though. Roman Catholic Bibles and many study Bibles include these writings. Many Protestant Bibles do not include them.
