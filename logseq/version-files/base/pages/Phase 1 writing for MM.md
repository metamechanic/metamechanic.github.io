- This is the writing that the first community participants, supporters, developers and backers will read
- Obviously I can't write everything. I have too many projects, and they are large in scope.
- Therefore, I must judiciously focus my writing to **balance breadth with depth**
	- Cover enough breadth to frame scope, purvue
	- Set the tone, philosophy, spirit, intentions
	- yet also provide enough detail, depth
- Writing to:
	- orient - what is my/our position in the noosphere; where do we want to go?
	- inspire participation, readership:
	- define boundaries, limits
	- distinguish from other efforts
		- why important
		- why unique
		- what do we do that other's don't
		- what don't/won't we do that others do do
- Definitive
- Prototype
- Exemplar
- Hypothetical, intuitive, exploratory...with need to research and make rigorous LATER
- Each project has:
	- 20 page project proposal
	- Macrobout complete
	- 20 "profile cards" in each of 5 types (eg. person, document, organisation,)
	- 5 x blogs
- 20-page project proposal template
	- Wireframe
	- Comparators-Competitors
	- Uniqueness, Novelty, Difference
	- Imperative, necessity
