-
- Data has attributes and can be categorized.
- The attributes and categories may be over-lapping.
- Mapping frameworks can be applied to the data
- The data can be visualized differently using the different frameworks.
-
- Eg. Geography.
- The location of nations can be mapped using latitude and longitude.
- They can also be classifed by eg.
- HDI
- Religious groups
- Statistical measurements eg. population,
- Types of government
-
-
- Additional cartographies can be added to the data in time, as they are invented or discovered.
- The data management tools must be able to adapt to this.
-
- The map can then be visualized.
- The map is created by designating the particular attributes to map.
- The data (organizations/individuals, ideas, objects...) will be situated differently according to different mapping schema.
-
- Information visualization is not enough. It often has a mapping schema implicit, BUT NOT EXPOSED.
- The idea of knowledge/futures mapping is to EXPOSE, CHANGE and PROBLEMATIZE the mapping schema.
- The purpose is to RECONTEXTUALIZE the information/data
- The purpose is to draw new maps.
-
- If we have a map, which in our linear minds has a start and a finish (a past, present, future) and that finish is not questioned...we don't have an alternative route.
- If we can draw new maps, with missing or heretofore undiscovered or uncreated "finishes" futures, then
-
- Relate MAPS with PURPOSE and DIRECTION.
- Where are we coming from? Where are we going to? And why?
-
- Maps are used so we can get from A to B.
- Maps are used so we can get an idea of the terrain (topography) - a localised 3-D map
- Maps are used to avoid dangers/pitfalls and navigate to safety.
- Maps are used to know what is out there.
- Maps are used to go to places when we need resources.
