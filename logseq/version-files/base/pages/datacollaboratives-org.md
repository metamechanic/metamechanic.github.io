- #### About
	- DataCollaboratives.org is a resource on creating public value by exchanging data. In sync with the mission of The [GovLab](http://www.thegovlab.org/), the site seeks to provide insight on how responsible exchange of corporate data can improve people’s lives. It results from different partnerships with UNICEF and Omidyar Network.
