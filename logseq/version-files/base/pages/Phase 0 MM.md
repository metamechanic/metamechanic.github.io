	-
- Write in Logseq
	- Tag heavily
	- Template everything #[[metamechanica tag taxonomy]]
	-
- Write and create, but also for showing to inner circle
	- Need combination of outward platform + inner platform
	- Outward platforms?
		- Notion
		- Obsidian Publish
		- Coda
		- Capacities
		- Anytype
	- Inward platforms?
		- Logseq
		- Obsidian
		- ...but want some database/table/card functionality
	- TEMPLATES (not Logseq templates)
		- References
		- People
		- Data viz (eg. for EFA)
- Platforms, Apps
- Focused on

- Metamechanic Mesh KM Phase 0 needs and not-needs
  collapsed:: true
	- needs
		- single note repository underlying all projects
		- outward-facing aspect
			- for
				- recruitment of collaborators
				- attraction of funding
				- invitation of ideas
			- needs to be visual and incorporate visual components
		- task prioritization tool
		- backlinking, wikilinking, predictive note linking
		- AI incorporation
		- show mock-ups
		- project URL redirect to showcase page
	- does not need
		- separate websites for each project
			- I need the unified knowledge respository underlying all projects and I don't have the tech skills to do this for separate websites
		- separate workspaces, graph databases
		- excessive polish
			- only enough to adequately communicate requirements and vision
- Workflow
	- Do
		- enter writing freely
		- tag readily and heavily
		- consolidate pre-existing notes
			- TBX
			- Scrivener
			- et al
		- learn to use tools of Logseq efficiently
			- transclusion
			- todo
			- tags
		- develop taxonomy and document it
		- document (ie. tag) heavily
		- use journal as primary entry point inconjunction with TAGS
		- occasional cleaning up of notes
			- via file size
			- via graph view
	- Do not
		- look for other platforms. Stick to Logseq for Phase 0
		- worry about "weeds in the garden" too much ie. that everything is not neat and tidy
		-
- This is the writing that the first community participants, supporters, developers and backers will read
	- How many? 3-10? Can't be too many as then it will have to be more polished.
- Obviously I can't write everything. I have too many projects, and they are large in scope.
- Therefore, I must judiciously focus my writing to **balance breadth with depth**
	- Cover enough breadth to frame scope, purvue
	- Set the tone, philosophy, spirit, intentions
	- yet also provide enough detail, depth
- Writing to:
	- orient - what is my/our position in the noosphere; where do we want to go?
	- inspire participation, readership:
	- define boundaries, limits
	- distinguish from other efforts
		- why important
		- why unique
		- what do we do that other's don't
		- what don't/won't we do that others do do
- Definitive
- Prototype
- Exemplar
- Hypothetical, intuitive, exploratory...with need to research and make rigorous LATER
- Each project has:
	- 20 page project proposal
	- Macrobout complete
	- 20 "profile cards" in each of 5 types (eg. person, document, organisation,)
	- 5 x blogs
- 20-page project proposal template
	- Wireframe
	- Comparators-Competitors
	- Uniqueness, Novelty, Difference
	- Imperative, necessity
