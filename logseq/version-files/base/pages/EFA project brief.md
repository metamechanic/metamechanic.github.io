	- Enough For All: so that more may be more and have more.
	- Stitching together the story of sufficiency
		- Not new data. Not a truly original story.  Enough For All pieces together disparate data from numerous reliable, authoritative organisations into a message of insight and hope: There is enough for all. Everyone can have enough.  EFA aims to provide a novel, simple, engaging and comprehensive way of understanding a complex, compelling tale: the how much and how of enough.
	- Illuminating the issue of enough
	- Why do some go hungry, malnourished, impoverished? Why are some homeless, landless and materially insecure? Why are some unhappy, unhealthy, unhelpful?  Have you ever asked yourself these questions? Have you ever wondered if there is more to the story than the answers you are given?  Enough For All seeks to address these questions and tell the story of sufficiency by starting with the basics, visualising the data, and using ‘warm logic’.
	- Visualizing The Story of the World
		- EFA sets out to piece together quality data and dedicated research into the story of enough  [Need diagram of story map…]
	- Communicating data for easier intellectual digestion  Simplifying the story so real problems and effective solutions become more apparent.
