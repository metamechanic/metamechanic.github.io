- [[Part 1 - The State of the World]] 
  collapsed:: true
  is dedicated to an overview of wealth, health, happiness, poverty, peace, prosperity - the pulse and pressure of the greater global system. It asks the questions: Where are we at right now? What’s the world like? Where are we heading? Who doesn’t have enough of what?

- [[Part 2. The Spiral of Satisfaction]] 
  collapsed:: true
  begins climbing the staircase of needs and tools from the material and concrete to the important intangible and ethereal.
	- [[Enough Stuff]] starts by looking at the state of generally regarded basic human necessities and materials: food, water, clothing, shelter, land. This section asks the questions: Is there enough of the essentials for all? If no, why not? And could we remedy this? If yes, then why do some not have enough?
	- [[Enough Technology]] begins to deepen the inquiry then by looking at how these raw materials are produced or not, distributed or not, wasted or not. Here we begin to look at underlying mechanisms which manipulate, amplify and extend the basic raw materials.
	- The upward spiral of needs and abstraction continues into [[Enough Ideas]] where we enter the realm of concept and philosophy, looking at the fundamental ideas and premises that technologies, systems and structures embody and embed.
- [[Part 3. Harnessing the Source of All]] 
  collapsed:: true
  continues the staged ascension from the concrete and begins by bridging from the previous part with the highest and greatest concepts - God, Meaning, Love, Infinity, Limitlessness…(and whatever related terms and concepts you prefer.)
	- [[Enough X]] looks at the intangible we all seek, spirituality, the Universe and meaningfulness-making. Re-Source then looks at techniques and practices that may strengthen that connection and refocus our enoughness-seeking in order to tap the Infinite Well.
- [[Part 4. Inspired Resource Utilization]]
  collapsed:: true
  the learnings discovered can be applied to systems, policies and technologies in an attempt to encourage resilience and robustness at all levels.
	- [[The Orthodox Solutions]] looks at current attempts to achieve this and offers critique based on prior learnings.
	- [[Fresh Alternatives]] then offers some other strategies and tools to more effectively achieve stated ambitions. It also reminds of the characteristics and features an ideal “Fresh Alternative” might consist of.
