- The who, what, how, when, where, why of the project
- This section rephrases the same points as [[EFA Overview & Outline]]
- see also: [[EFA 1-page project brief]]
- ## What
	- ### Summary
	  collapsed:: true
	  EFA may be summarised in the following points:
		- A community-curated, expert-moderated data portal around poverty, peace, prosperity, happiness, health and wealth, operating at multiple levels of analysis.
		- One-stop data shop on indicators, statistics, insights and commentary across economics, development, psychology, technology and trends for the general public.
		- A graphical narrative cohering multiple inadequacies, insufficiences, excesses and wastes, and their potential solutions, into a unifying framework.
		- A centralizing hub for producers of rigorous research and generators of high-quality data so that their contribution can be situated into a bigger picture and grander, coherent, explicit narrative.
		- A simplification (but not too much!) and distillation of the overwhelming, complex, universal issue of insufficiency and inadequacy.
	- ### Features & Characteristics
	  collapsed:: true
	  The overarching purpose and rationale of the Enough For All project is to cohere disparate, high-quality data and analysis on the universal theme of scarcity-abundance, into a sensible, bigger picture, coherent narrative of insight, and actionable hope. 
	  To facilitate this EFA incorporates certain features and characteristics.
		- #### Sense-making
			- Data from reliable, authoritative sources.
			  collapsed:: true
				- EFA does not do any original primary data research. Our role is to situate it in context in a bigger narrative and framework, illuminating relationships between data sets, perspectives and arguments.
			- First principles.
			  collapsed:: true
				- EFA begins from first principles of raw data, without significant benefit or bias from extensive experience in economics, development policy, behavioural sciences or conventional fields. It will use these critical logic steps to move from a data set to multiple possible upstream causes, downstream effects, drill inward to higher resolution analysis and outward to broader contextualisation of the issue. It is expected that some key assumptions, biases and myths inherent in conventional approaches become apparent through this, as may strengths and benefits.
		- #### Structure
			- Critical logic pathways.
			  collapsed:: true
				- If-then reckoning, assumptions and premises, logical conclusions and implications are all hypertexually constructed via modern web tools.
				- Allows user-driven (reader-critic) plot pathway navigation to make sense of the story, construct understanding of the issues, and posit alternative cause-effect relationships, while maintaining global meaning and connection between data, arguments and layers.
			- Multi-layered analysis for the depth of reality.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Reality has multiple layers, different according to different frameworks. Most frameworks, philosophies and disciplines favour and privilege particular layer(s). EFA seeks to traverse all layers getting to the roots of insufficiency and inadequacy at all levels.
				- There are levels of detail and granularity in data. EFA’s emphasis is on the Big Picture however it incorporates a sufficient level of granularity to support any prevailing grand pattern. The story structure allows the reader deeper investigation as well as more superficial story skimming and terrain orientation. One could picture a tree-like or pyramidal structure of data nodes which each reconnecting later into a complex system of sub-issues as well as narrative elements.
		- #### Visual Language and Knowledge Cartography.
		  collapsed:: true
			- EFA will favour graphical methods to illuminate the story of enough over lengthy literary pieces. This allows for easier assimilation of big data, wicked problems and complex issues.
			- Data visualisations.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Pictures speaks a thousand words. Why not let the graphics say what they can? Text is used to summarise, critique and ponder, and not to replace data visualisations. Such text should then ideally be represented in yet another visual language format.
			- Knowledge Cartography
			  collapsed:: true
				- argument visualisations
				- debate graphs
				- issue maps
				- infographics
				- augmented text.
		- #### Curated, Critical Crowd-Sourcing
			- Critical Crowd-sourced.
			  collapsed:: true
				- The story of the world requires the world to write it. Country analysts, issue specialists, discipline disciples  - all required. Data freaks, infographics geeks, and constructive critiques. We need you. UN, NGOs, EDUs, NPOs, VIPs, NFIs… all have a role to play.
			- Community-curated and critically crafted.
			  collapsed:: true
				- While all contributions are welcome not all contributions are equal. Feedback is given, and welcomed, to maintain the standards, message and integrity of the EFA venture while maintaining spirited, constructive debate.
			- Expert-moderated.
			  collapsed:: true
				- We seek to take advantage of the trained and experienced in streamlining and elevating the narrative. However, experts disagree, they also make mistakes and can be blinded by their own 'expertness'.
				- Innovation and insight often come from outside the domain of 'experts'. [[Enough Expertise]] will also be critically evaluated.

- ## What for?
  What is EFA trying to accomplish?
	- [[Purpose, Aims & Objectives of EFA]];
- ## Why: 
  collapsed:: true
  There are a number of reasons EFA exists as a web-based exploration of enough. See also:  [[Rationale for EFA]]
	- Personal curiosity around the driving questions.
		- These are [some big questions]([[Driving Questions of EFA]]); perhaps even the biggest of questions. What can be more worthwhile pursuing?
	- Leverage and efficacy of social contribution
	  collapsed:: true
		- Maybe I can help? Charity and activism may not always be enough. And how effective is (my) charity and activism? Are there better ways to channel resources? Better attitudes towards these practices? Are there particularly powerful pressure points?
	- Spiritual practice.
	  collapsed:: true
		- I suspect my own fulfillment is linked to filling the bellies, pockets, hearts, minds and souls of as many as possible. I suspect the process may help uncover and illuminate my own resistance to enough: in myself, and for others. I also suspect I may not be alone in this.
	- Combat hopelessness, powerlessness and apathy.
	  collapsed:: true
		- These themselves symbolise a sense of scarcity - a common response in the face of overwhelming, grave, complex issues. A purpose of EFA is to alleviate this by identifying points of powerful action and frameworks of understanding.
	- No one does not lack something.
	  collapsed:: true
		- This project may help heal my own personal senses of poverty through understanding and action, and therefore may serve a similar role for others. Much of the modern, industrial malaise is a sense of meaninglessness, despair and depression in an age of unprecedented material wealth. There is a need to inter-relate (in)sufficiency of all types, at all levels, in all dimensions across all sectors to address all forms of poverty, inner and outer.
	- “Market need.”
	  collapsed:: true
		- No one single forum (to the best of my knowledge) unites and integrates discussion around sufficiency, at all levels, in all dimensions, in a convenient, digestible manner. There is no place an educated layperson can go for a synopsis of sufficiency made sensible through story, where they can also get more detail and generate further curiosity.
	- Dissatisfaction with many common views on the matter.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Many approaches devalue or ignore significant dimensions of reality and being. Because I postulate there can be enough OF everything FOR every thing. And I postulate that we’re going the wrong way about satisfactorily accomplishing that.
	- Why the bloody hell not?
	  collapsed:: true
		- Sometimes something just grips you and won’t let go.
	- Decomplexification and distillation
	  collapsed:: true
	  Overwhelming issues made visible, manageable and hopeful.
		- Most of us feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the world and hopeless when we look at the scale of suffering and conflict. Many of us choose not to look for this reason.  Enough For All seeks to not only present data in a way that is digestible, but offer hope and mechanisms for alleviating suffering, resolving conflict and addressing poverties and inequalities.
		- Disconnection, incoherence
		- Depression and despair turned into a new direction
		  Depressing data into a message of hope and power

- ## Who
	- Audience, Targets, Participants & Contributors
	  collapsed:: true
	  Who is this for? Who is this by?
		- Everyone & Everything.
		  collapsed:: true
			- If it experiences or plays a role in (in)sufficiency, then it will be brought into the story, at some point, at some time.
		- For “me.”
		  collapsed:: true
			- No, not "you" but “me”. First and foremost, EFA wants to take the stance that personal responsibility underpins all collective efforts to provide and ensure enough, informing the group dynamics and socio-economic structures that operate. Any and all exhortations towards others to change must be preceded by a willingness to do the same, or at least recognise any double-standards and hypocrisy. We all retain the power of decision at a mental level and it is this power we hope to cultivate as our primary change mechanism.
		- The “rich” as well as the “poor”. The "pious" as well as the perverted.
		  collapsed:: true
			- No one has enough of everything, at all times. We all lack something. We’re all searching for something. Everyone is grappling with something. Lack goes by many names, some of which may be more obvious than others.
		- For those who are not struggling day-to-day and have a certain minimum level of material resource.
		  collapsed:: true
			- For many in the world putting food on the table and securing day-to-day survival are their only foci. And so it should be. This project is for those who have the resources to devote to reading, research, reflection and rejoicing in enough.
		- For the founder, Adam Duus.
		  collapsed:: true
			- I want enough. In fact, I want more than enough…but I don’t want it to necessarily be at the expense of others, the planet or the future. I intuitively suspect that others having enough is intimately linked to my own sense of abundance. If you resonate with this, then EFA may be for you too.
		- For the curious, the skilled, the knowledgeable; by the same.
		  collapsed:: true
			- EFA community, as a project development and expansion team, as quality control, as advocates, as exemplars. This is not one man’s mission but an armada sailing to new horizons.
			- Contributors: Web developers, data viz gurus, subject matter experts, philanthropists, writer-researchers, friendly critics, graphic designers, the socially conscious, social media networkers…

	  Who began this?
- ## Where?
  collapsed:: true
	- Bio-physical space
	  Material resources, requirements and ramifications
	- Socio-econo-political space
	  Systems, cultures, tools and movements that help and hinder
	- Psycho-spiritual space
	  Deeper longings, drivers and demons
	- Global in geographical range. Universal in psychological scope.
	- Hearts, minds, bellies as well as hip pockets and Mars rockets
- ## When
	- Present
	  collapsed:: true
		- What does present data say about the current status of sufficiency and abundance?
		- Do we have enough now? Do I feel like I _am_ enough right now?
		- Our memories and future fears are plagued by thoughts of insufficiency: I didn’t do enough, I didn’t have enough, and it looks like I won't in the future. How can we heal this angst?
	- Past
	  collapsed:: true
		- Has there always been lack, or alternatively, enough? Is this a perpetual problem, independent of time?
		- Is my sense of inadequacy and our common insufficiency rooted in events, episodes and decisions from the past? How far back?
		- How much are current actions towards 'security' driven by past memories, lessons and experiences?
	- Future
	  collapsed:: true
		- What do the forecasts say? What do technophiles, economagicians, apocalyptists, geopolitickers and fringe theorists predict and promise? This time will it really be different?
		- Do we have enough now? Or is our fear of lack for the future, a time to come?
		- Our plans are often attempts to secure enough or assure enough. How can we plan well? Is our planning counter-productive? Might it reinforce poverty?
	- In time. Beyond time.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Enough time. Time for what? Enoughness is rooted in purpose. What is (y)our purpose?
		- Enough life. What lies beyond death? How does this impact our sense of abundance and adequacy before death?
		- Timelessness. The Eternal. The Infinite Patience.
- ## How
	- A simplified story to help make simple sense.
	  collapsed:: true
		- We remember stories, not disconnected facts.
		- Disconnected facts are not disconnected. They have causes, conclusions, connections and conflicts. Facts must be situated; analyses contextualised.
		- Modern hypertext web tools can help with following complex stories.
	- Authoritative, diverse data sources introduced and curated by a community of contributors and critics.
	  collapsed:: true
		- EFA draws on a range of high-quality data sources and leading analysis providers across a range of sectors and disciplines.
		- A fleet of contributors, across the world, working across all sectors and levels.
	- EFA will attempt to include and appropriately weight and balance all aspects, levels, dimensions of such questions. A full spectrum consideration might cover:
	  collapsed:: true
		- All layers of discourse and levels of nested hierarchies eg. individual - community - national/cultural/collective group - global - universal
		- Non-physical reality: interior-exterior, physical-mental, conscious-unconscious, material-intangible
		- Me-other balancings: rights-responsibilities, individual-group, structures-agency, freedoms-duties, benefits-risks
		- Timeframes: Immediate short-term, near-term, mid-term, long-term, eternal
	- Multi-leveled Frameworks of Analysis - Overview
	  There exist some
		- [[Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs]]
		- [[Causal Layered Analysis]] by [[Sohail Inayatullah]], building on the work of [[PR Sarkar]]
		- Ken Wilber's [[AQAL Integral theory]] , which builds on Clare Graves' [[Spiral Dynamics]]
		- the [[Chakra system]]
	- EFA feels exploration of this topic is best served by largely visual means. This includes:
	  collapsed:: true
		- Data visualizations: graphs, charts
		- Frameworks and Maps:
			- knowledge (where in the knowledge domain),
			- debate (where in the argument arena),
			- geospatial (where in the physical world),
			- narrative (where in the story)
		- Argument visualizations and critical logic flow representations
		- Infographics
