- I am sure you are all familiar with the Crackpot Index devised by John Baez as a “fun” way to identify “crackpots”. Now there is also a growing phenomenon of the anti-crackpots, that is people who go to enormous trouble to try to debunk other people’s theories but instead of using solid arguments they produce a useless diatribe laced with rhetoric, sarcasm  and irrelevant ridicule. I think it is now time to redress the balance and produce the anti-crackpot index as a fun way to help  identify such people, so here it is:
  The Anti-crackpot index
- A -5 point starting credit
- 1 point for claiming a point is “vacuous” or “specious” without saying why.
- 2 points for referring to other people as “the public” or “laymen” without having any relevant qualifications beyond highschool themselves.
- 3 points for dismissing an extensive theory because of one minor error.
- 5 points for each statement that is adhered to despite careful correction.
- 5 points for suggesting someone is not a real scientist because they did not use TeX.
- 5 points for each use of the word falsifiable.
- 5 points for gratuitously pointing out that a person they are attacking is Female.
- 10 points for saying that someone is taking mathematics too literally.
- 10 points for telling a scientist or mathematician that they should leave philosophy to the philosophers.
- 10 points for claiming that any correct idea can easily be published in a peer-reviewed journal or the arXiv.
- 10 points for invoking a strawman argument.
- 10 points for believing that any good idea will instantly be recognised as such by the scientific community.
- 10 points for claiming that someone is a crackpot because they will not listen to reason, when in fact the position is mutual.
- 10 points for seamlessly switching to a new argument when an old one is found wanting.
- 10 points for quoting something and implying the reader should see how ridiculous it is without actually saying why.
- 10 points for jumping from a reasonable but irrelevant set of sociological arguments to a sudden unwarranted conclusion that a theory has therefore failed.
- 10 points for saying an idea is wrong because it violates a scientific principle that has not been tested in the context of the theory.
- 10 points for using a wrong argument to attack a possibly correct argument.
- 20 points for using technical jargon to try to make themselves appear knowledgable.
- 20 points for mentioning the Ignobel prize.
- 20 points for pointing out spelling or grammar errors as part of their critique (double points for making similar errors at the same time).
- 20 points for citing Feynman’s cargo cult science speech.
- 20 points for using a blog, wiki or forum that is specifically created for debunking “crackpot” theories.
- 20 points if the said website deploys adverts that promote pseudoscience (double points if its Google Adwords)
- 20 points for showing a picture of themselves that reveals a ponytail.
- 20 points for using an anonymous pseudonym when your opponent is using their real name.
- 20 points for saying they always own up to their errors because they were forced to do it once.
- 30 points for citing a comic strip such as xkcd or Abstruce Goose.
- 30 points for labelling themselves as a “skeptic” without associating this to a specific claim that they are skeptical about.
- 30 points for extending an analogy beyond its intended scope in order to break it.
- 30 points for saying something is “not even wrong”.
- 40 points for saying “A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing”.
- 40 points for implying they are a science expert when they are really a software engineer with a blog (double points if they are employed by Google).
- 40 points for taking the Baez crackpot index too seriously.
- 40 points for suggesting additions to the crackpot index.
- 50 points for saying a paper makes no testable predictions and failing noticing that very few genuine scientific papers make any testable predictions.
