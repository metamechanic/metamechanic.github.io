- **Embrace uncertainty and volatility:** Rather than fearing the unknown, view it as an opportunity for growth and improvement.
- **Develop mental resilience:** Practice techniques like Seneca’s “premeditation of evils” to prepare for potential setbacks and reduce their emotional impact.
- **Reframe adversity as opportunity:** Look for ways to gain from difficult situations, turning stressors into sources of strength.
- **Cultivate an antifragile mindset:** Instead of merely being robust or resilient, aim to benefit from disorder and challenges.
- **Practice emotional positioning:** Use mental exercises to reduce the sting of potential losses and maintain psychological freedom.
- **Seek out controlled stressors:** Engage in activities that challenge you mentally and physically to promote growth and adaptation.
- **Avoid overprotection:** Recognize that excessive shielding from difficulties can lead to weakness and fragility.
- **Transform negative emotions:** Convert fear into prudence, pain into information, and mistakes into learning opportunities.
- **Invite constructive criticism:** Actively seek feedback to improve and evolve, recognizing that this process, while potentially uncomfortable, leads to growth.
