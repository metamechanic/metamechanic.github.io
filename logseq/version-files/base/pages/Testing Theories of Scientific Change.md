- Post-positivist scholars (Kuhn, [[Lakatos]], Laudan) question this. Laudan, Laudan and Donovan (1988) have proposed seven theses regarding how scientists react to anomalies:
- When a theory encounters an anomaly or a paradox, then scientists
	- (1) believe that this reflects adversely on their skills rather than on the inadequacies of the theory.
	  (2) leave the anomaly/paradox unresolved.
	  (3) refuse to change their assumptions.
	  (4) ignore the anomaly/paradox as long as the theory continues to anticipate novel phenomena successfully.
	  (5) believe that the anomaly/paradox becomes grounds for rejecting the theory only if it persistently resists solution.
	  (6) introduce hypotheses which are not testable in order to save the theory.
	  (7) believe that the anomaly/paradox becomes acute only if a rival theory explains it.
