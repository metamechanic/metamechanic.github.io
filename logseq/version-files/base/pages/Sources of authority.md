A visual knowledge map showing attributions and allocations of authority. 
title:: Sources of authority

I suspect there are only a few fundamental archetypal maps. 

The lower level actors, agents and authorities may differ but then you eventually arrive at the usual suspects:
- religion,
- god,
- the body/senses,
- "rights",
	- UN declaration of rights
	- historical rights
	- "innate" rights
- empirical science
- common sense
- collective "intelligence"
- unquestioned tradition
