  *The other thing that you’ve done – and you’re still a bit of a rebel in this regard – is to propose the question of the expanding Earth.*
  
  No longer a rebel – they now believe it! At least, they all will eventually. It takes some people a while to catch up.
  
  *What made you think of an expanding Earth as the explanation for what you saw? Was it purely that you were fitting the continents together and it didn’t fit?*
  
  Well, I put the continents together and there was a big hole. I had to have that or more than half the world as ocean. It seemed to be a better solution, because there was a great area where I believed the edges of those things belonged to each other, across the Pacific. And the north Pacific had rims which belonged to each other.
