- 3 key questions about QM
	- What does QM tell us about the nature of reality?
	- What determines the outcomes? What exactly causes a specific outcome to happen over another when we measure a quantum system?
	- Role of the Observer: Does the observer influence what happens, or is measurement simply a way to passively learn about something that's already "out there"?
