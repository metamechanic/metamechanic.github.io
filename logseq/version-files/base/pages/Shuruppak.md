- In Sumerian legend as the place of the flood, which destroyed all humanity except one survivor, Ziusudra. He had been commanded by a protecting god to build an ark, in which he rode out the disaster, afterward re-creating man and living things upon the earth, and was himself endowed with eternal life. [[Ziusudra]] corresponds with [[Utnapishtim]] in the Gilgamesh epic and with the biblical Noah.
