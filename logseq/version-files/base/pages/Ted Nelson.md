- [[Jaron Lanier]]Â explained the difference between the World Wide Web and Nelson's vision, and the implications:
- >A core technical difference between a Nelsonian network and what we have become familiar with online is that [Nelson's] network links were two-way instead of one-way. In a network with two-way links, each node knows what other nodes are linked to it. ... Two-way linking would preserve context. It's a small simple change in how online information should be stored that couldn't have vaster implications for culture and the economy.[[1(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson#cite_note-15)
