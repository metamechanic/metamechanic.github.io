	  collapsed:: true
		- Structure as a contrast against scientific materialist, religious creationist, new-age quantum mystic, atheists, and activists, conspiracy theorists, post-modern deconstructionists,
			- Reinforce what the good of each school is eg. the good of science is reliance on evidence: seek for yourself;
			- remind of the not-so-good: eg. that reality is just material, only the five senses or God is energy (new-age);
			- steps towards salvation eg. consciousness is more than we think, but also less ie. not God.
		- Common messages are present throughout the entire book
		- Concepts & ideas in one part support others elsewhere in the book
		- The subway map system of thinking about God.
		- A flowchart with Yes-No question triggers, resulting in various pathways to "God"/god. Can colour code, like a subway system map. Follows a Yes-No type Q&A diagram down to a conclusion. Each pathway is a colour-coded route.
			- Eg. Good and evil. See notebook for examples 210412?? with each issue ending in something like “It does not really matter. The goal is to FORCK You!” – quote from ACIM: “A universal theology is impossible but a universal experience is necessary.”
		- bite-size entries of a few paragraphs; these interlink to build bigger network
		- don't try to get exhaustive in listings, explanation, refutations etc
			- instead focus on over-arching and underlying principles
			- explanations and arguments can be elaborated upon in future works, perhaps using DiaGnosis
		- In a way an explanation of many principles of MetaMechanica
		- Inspired by ACIM but not ACIM
		- Tackle same/similar/recurring points from different starting thoughts. Eg. in “Foundational Concepts” start with the concept and then comment on misconceptions. In “Misconceptions” start with misconception, comment and then return to foundational concept.

  Practical Responses to the Metaphysics & Misconceptions
	- forget-forgive; remember-dismember
	- You can't fix what is designed to be broken.
	- Purpose is everything. Inner motivation, moreso than outer mechanism, determines outcome.
	- Anything that requires defense is inherently weak. But that does not necessarily mean you should not defend it.
	- The real jihad is the one within, with your own demons.
	- Spiritual development is the shift from taking zero responsibility for one’s situation to total responsibility for one’s situation.
	- Spiritual growth is the expansion of the circle of compassion. More identifying types are included -> Neohumanism / Sarkar circle
		- Expanding the circle of identity.

		- territory
	- Spiritual path is one of increasing abstraction
	- FORCK closes the gap between you and your (br)others. This includes species, objects, thought systems and not only people. Furthermore, this includes your other selves. (We all carry multiple voices, multiple role players)
	- Implement the message. Don’t idolise the man. Try to follow the example yourself. Don’t make an example of the failings of others.
	- You cannot add to God.
		- You can only remove the blocks to the awareness of god.
	- de-centering
	- FORCK
	  collapsed:: true
		- FORCK You!
		- All religions, sects, faiths, teachings have value. All have a role to play.
			- All religions, sects, faiths, teachings must ultimately be transcended.
		- What is required, however, is our own forgiveness of ourselves and our deep-seated, unconscious guilt. I miscreated something imperfect and

			-
		- FORCK closes the gap between you and your (br)others. This includes species, objects, thought systems and not only people. Furthermore, this includes your other selves. (We all carry multiple voices, multiple role players)
		- An ever increasing Circle of compassion, at a mental level
			- at a physical, worldly level, no system can include everyone or everything, nor should it
		- Where does your love stop?
		- Life is letting go if the limits to love.
		- Spiritual growth is the expansion of the circle of compassion. More identifying types are included -> Neohumanism / Sarkar circle
		- Expanding the circle of identity
		- Forgiveness - ego’s version versus Holy Spirit’s version

			- The world will be okay when you change what you believe.

		- To…
			- The world will be okay when I change what I believe.
	- Otherism
	  collapsed:: true
		- Discrimination by being an ‘other’. Prejudice against an other.
		- Everyone is ‘otherist’
		- We deny it by making special forms of ‘otherism’, and quickly rejecting those, removing ourselves from that category, or justifying our establishment of the category.
		- Otherism happens at a mental level
			- one can assess based on outward group identity and not be discriminatory or prejudiced
			- on the other hand, one can take no external worldly action or word, and yet be very much discriminatory, either
		- Do you get upset at someone else? Do you get upset at yourself? If so, then you are otherist. Why? Because you are saying “You are the cause of my suffering.”
		- The only possibility to world peace is through inner peace, which comes from recognising and then accepting that you are otherist. Only then can you forgive yourself.
		- Otherism is only resolved through the realisation that there is no other. This realisation is facilitated through the practice of advanced forgiveness and compassion.
	- Anger, doubt, jealousy, confusion, hatred, cynicism, boredom, apathy…are all masks of fear. Fear arises from a sense of guilt because a sense of guilt calls for punishment. Therefore surface fears are the tip of the iceberg of the deeper fear of punishment from God. But, critically, it is me who has ascribed the attribute of Punisher to God.
	- Everything is technology. That includes ideas, concepts and thought systems.
	- The history of the world is the story of the projection of pollution, pain, power-source and problem-source onto others. The future of the world is the same unless we learn to give a FORCK.
	- The purpose and role of questioning
		- Questioning as genuine inquiry and discovery
		- Questioning as a delay manoever and divisive mechanism
	- Spirituality is the practice of one’s idea of oneself. Therefore, everyone is spiritual.
	- All practice – spiritual, religious, scientific, artistic, mundane – is valuable if it promotes forgiveness, compassion and kindness.
	- Faith is the bridge between belief and knowledge.
	- Seek not to change your behaviour. Seek to change your mind.
	- Spiritual development is the process of removing obstacles to including
	- Spiritual development is the shift from taking zero responsibility for one’s situation to total responsibility for one’s situation.
	- Spiritual development is the shift of all power being seemingly outside and external to oneself, to the recognition that all power is within oneself.
	- Your experience is evidence of your beliefs.
	- Beliefs don’t make Reality or Truth but they do make the appearance of it.
	- Meditation & prayer access the Inner Teacher and Higher Power that lies within all of us.
	- Seek not to change your behaviour. Seek to change your mind.
	- The truth doesn’t require defence. However, our Truth “muscle” is very weak and thus requires vigilance against the attacks of the ego.
	- Anything that requires defense is inherently weak.
	- History is the story of the projection of power, pain, pollution.
	- The world confuses Truth with truth-tools.
	- Beliefs don’t make Reality or Truth but they do make the appearance of it.

		- All practice – spiritual, religious, scientific, artistic, mundane – is valuable if it promotes FORCK: forgiveness, compassion and kindness.
		- Spiritual progress is measured by an increasing experience of peace, not by time spent meditating or healing modalities mastered, nor by any worldly metric of status.
		-
	- The body
		- Brain and heart as "signal receivers" or "signal detectors" rather than "signal generators"
	- Spiritual development is the shift of all power being seemingly outside and external to oneself, to the recognition that all power is within oneself. That all responsibility lies with me.

			- Similarity of “saviour” stories (disproving)

  collapsed:: true
	- Transparency
	  I am an ACIM student. My study & practice of ACIM has inspired me to write this book.
	  However…
	- The ideas reflected in this book do not necessarily represent the teachings of ACIM. For that you must read, study and apply The Course yourself.
	- This is not an advertisement for ACIM, per se. It is not an advertisement for any one particular spiritual faith, tradition, denomination, group or whatever.
	  It is, however, an appeal to FORCK. It is an appeal to become more forgiving, more compassionate and more kind. Metaphysics is presented here to facilitate this. Myths and misconceptions are discussed to help remove barriers to FORCKing yourself. This book is an appeal to you to undertake whatever spiritual practice helps you become more FORCK. I don’t care if its ACIM or not. That is just the truth-tool I use. It works for me. Just remember, whatever spiritual path you pursue is not the Truth. It is a way to Truth.
	- I am not a spiritual teacher, of ACIM or anything else. I have the worldly teachers I respect and refer to, according to the guidance of the higher Teacher within (the Teacher that resides within all of us).
	  Disclosure statement: My work inspired by ACIM, or rather, the Presence that the practice of ACIM makes available to me.
	  An acknowledgment and appeal from the author
	  About Adam
	- Comment on moving forward – future books will emerge from this one, expanding on principles presented.
