- Context, background
-
- I spend a lot of time on my computer. You may wonder what I do, what I spend my time on. Well, when I have not lost myself in a YouTube doomscroll, I am reading and watching content related to various ideas and topics that may be incorporated into a number of project ideas.
- This short piece is to share with my family and closest friends to give you a very brief insight into one such project I have been thinking about and trying to work on for a little while.
- I thought I'd better write a little about this particular one, as opposed to the other project ideas, because:
  collapsed:: true
	- it is the most personal, and personally insightful into me and an aspect of my life I don't advertise. Yet this aspect informs my life most fundamentally.
	- I've recognised this project could be the foundational work for many of the other project ideas which may follow.
		- Ideas developed in this while probably permeate and underpin the others.
		- Alternatively, other project ideas could be said to be domain-specific expressions or explorations of the more general ideas explored in this work.
- My current working title for this intellectual project is "Another M-Theory", or 'AMT' for short.
- [[M-theory]] refers to a theory, or a set of theories, in physics that is an attempt at a theory of 'everything'.
  collapsed:: true
	- I put 'everything' in quotes because, in my view, proponents are selective and reductive about what constitutes a thing to include in 'everything'. Adherents generally adhere to [[scientific materialism]].
- AMT is my response to this, as well as other schools of thought on, what I call, #GUSTO - God-Universe-Space-Time-Organization
	- Hopefully I can write on #GUSTO with gusto.
- The work will introduce some metaphysical, metaphorical, psychological, macroscientific and non-dual spiritual ideas which will then be applied to some issues and topics in the world.
	- 'M' as a letter turns out to be a convenient organising and cohering device. Hopefully it won't turn out as corny as it may sound right now.
- It is heavily inspired by, and draws very extensively from, A Course In Miracles (ACIM). However, I don't claim I am a teacher of ACIM, or am teaching the principles of ACIM in this work.
	- ACIM would say "to teach is to demonstrate", and I am a long way off consistently and clearly demonstrating forgiveness, compassion and kindness ([[FORCK]]).
- Being a framework of everything, it does also hope to draw on other spiritual traditions, particularly the non-dual Eastern teachings, as well as science and the arts.
- It is a 'book' about a quasi-framework of everything.
	- I say 'book' because it won't (yet) be a book in the traditional, conventional sense: an exposition of a topic or story in a largely linear format. Rather, it will be hypermedia based, taking advantage of modern web tools to facilitate non-linear, symphonic reading, surfing, and browsing. As such, it may take some getting used to the platform and style.
	- I say 'framework' rather than the common 'theory' of everything because I sense it is more of a starting point from which, or within which, to develop more helpful theories.
	- I emphasise 'quasi' because of a fundamental tenet of this very framework: that a theory unifying and uniting everything is impossible because the world is built on disunity. Concomitantly, time will show the current
- The hope of this work is to:
	- Explore and clarify some metaphysical principles for myself, theoretically, so that I may deepen their practice and application, experientially.
		- Writing as spiritual practice. Writing for spiritual practice.
	- Share some ideas I have come across which may be helpful, provocative or save time in such domains as:
		- individuals' spiritual practice and personal journeys
		- debates around God, the Universe, and Everything, or, in other words...
		- debates around, within and between science, religion, politics, economics, psychology et al
	- Pay it forward
		- I have been blessed in meeting and being inspired and/or supported by many mega-minds and wholesome hearts. I feel a duty to report on where they (thankfully) lead me.
- This work doesn't aim to be final. Instead, I foresee it being a launching platform of further exposition, explanation, exploration, expansion and experimentation.
	- There will be much positing, asserting, assuming, proposing, and some exploration of the consequences, but with further and more detailed considerations to be expounded in later works.
	- This work is limited by my own experience of the theoretical principles posited. As I endeavour to practice and embody the theory in my life, (a notably contradictory absence from many theories of everything), I hope that theory morphs into experience, as words and symbols become secondary.
- The ideas herein are not necessarily original. I have been taught and inspired by [others]([[people inspiring AMT]]), which I shall gladly acknowledge. The packaging, presentation, combination, re-interpretation and re-combination of such ideas may be novel, however.
- I don't expect great success with this endeavour, though I do hope for at least some. A central idea is that of Freudian resistance, even at a collective unconscious level, resulting in rejection. We can only experience to the degree of Truth that we are ready to accept, revolting against, and hiding from, the rest. That is a gradual awakening with bumps and bruises along the way, though these need not draw tears.
	- Questioners expect and only accept answers within the framework they have already implicitly defined.
		- There may be an outward, stated, explicit framework but it often doesn't take much to see there is an assumed, implicit framework in which the question is embedded, often revealing it is not so much of a question as a statement with a question mark. #[[Questions are propaganda for themselves]]
		- When talking about
- Spawned (or driven?) by
	- arguments between atheists and religious scientists
	- differing interpretations of quantum mechanics
	- reports from the mystics, as well as the mystically-appreciative scientists
	- a sense of universals and A Universal, along with general trends through history across the world
	- conspiracy theories with varying degrees of truth
	- the history of science as the history of wrongness as well as a story of hope
	- humanity's displays of enlightened action while simultaneously shooting itself in the foot
