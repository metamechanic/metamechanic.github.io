- “A saying by the brothers Geoff and Vince Graham summarizes the ludicrousness of scale-free political universalism:
  I am, at the Fed level, libertarian; 
  at the state level, Republican; 
  at the local level, Democrat; 
  and at the family and friends level, a socialist. 
  If that saying doesn’t convince you of the fatuousness of left vs. right labels, nothing will.”

	- Ken Wilber gives a similar quote about the Buddha; something about being an inner republican but an outer democrat #toSource
