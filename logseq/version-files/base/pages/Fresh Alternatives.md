- [[Definitions and Criteria for Fresh Alternatives]]
	- Comparing and contrasting: Are existing mainstream alternatives really different?
	- Reframing and reinterpreting: Are ideas self-contradictory or hypocritical? Do they hide conflicting assumptions?
	- Expanding and enlarging: Are there other ideas which are resisted and ridiculed because of their potential power?
	- Distilling and discerning: Some conspiracy theories are cuckoo and disempowering. Some are more rigorous and supported.
	- Personal and social responsibility: Explains and includes more. It seems to work better on paper. Warrants examination and experimentation.
	- More data. More of society: Reframes, retools and reinterprets evidence and events in order to empower and explain.
	- Discourages victimhood. Encourages personal, social and civilizational responsibility. Empowers agency and understanding.
	- Typically does not receive significant mainstream media airtime at present. If/when it does, it is presented as crackpot, not given fair representation, overwhelmed by better-resourced opposing voices, or legislated against, or rabidly denounced (provide examples of each).

	- Rationale for Fresh Alternatives - why
		- Because there is more to the world than we think. [[Truth is stranger than fiction]] . Ignorance is greater than (small-k) knowledge.
		- Innovation, transformation and vision come from the fringe. So does the crazy. A balance is needed. An open but critical analysis is warranted.
		- Removing the venom, vitriole and vilification from arguments about alternatives.
		- When you realise your "choices" are two sides of the same coin. When the explanations don't seem adequate.
		- Mainstream alternatives are often the other side of the same coin. Conspiracy theories vary from compelling evidence and sensible stories containing elements of truth descending all the way down to deliberate deception and disempowering self-victimisation. We cannot blindly accept nor deny. Value and power lie in discernment.
		- History is the history of elites and victors, not necessarily of balance. Dominant theory sometimes dismisses disruptive data. Social systems can be legacies of outdated institutions. The same for all fields of inquiry. What gems have been buried, are neglected or go under-utilised because they are terrifying or troublesome to special interests or the collective (un)conscious?
		- Conspiracy theories, just like everyone else, combine nuggets of startling truth and noble intentions with smatterings of crazy, wishful thinking and blame projection. They can cultivate victimhood, displace anger and distract from effective living. Ultimately they may not empower any more than what they oppose.
		- Yesterday’s revolutionary is today’s leader is tomorrow’s tyrant. “Truth” regularly proves untrue or incomplete. Useful tools can become outdated.
		- To make an informed, enlightened choice, one must be informed of the distinct choices available.
		- Because "out of the box" has become so cliche. Because "revolution" only takes us around in circles.
		- Ockham's razor requires a skilled and responsible hand.
		- There's more to the world than we think. There are more options than we each individually can be aware of.
		- An abundance of useful alternatives don’t get a voice.
		- In a world of big data and information gluttony, awareness of our options is still limited.
