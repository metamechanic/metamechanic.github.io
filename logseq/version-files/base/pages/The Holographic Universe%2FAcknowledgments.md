- Writing is always a collaborative effort and many people have contributed to the production of this book in various ways. It is not possible to name them all, but a few who deserve special mention include:
- [[David Bohm]] , Ph.D., and [[Karl Pribram]] , Ph.D., who were generous with both their time and their ideas, and without whose work this book would not have been written.
- [[Barbara Brennan]] , M.S., [[Larry Dossey]] , M.D., [[Brenda Dunne]] , Ph.D., [[Elizabeth W. Fenske]] , Ph.D., Gordon Globus, Jim Gordon, [[Stanislav Grof]] , M.D., Francine Howland, M.D., Valerie Hunt, Ph.D., [[Robert Jahn]] , Ph.D., Ronald Wong Jue, Ph.D., Mary Orser, F. David Peat, Ph.D., Elizabeth Rauscher, Ph.D., Beatrice Rich, Peter M. Rojcewicz, Ph.D., Abner Shimony, Ph.D., [[Bernie S. Siegel]], M.D., T.M. Srinivasan, M.D., [[Whitley Strieber]] , [[Russell Targ]], [[William A. Tiller]] , Ph.D., Montague Ullman, M.D., Lyall Watson, Ph.D., Joel L. Whitton, M.D., Ph.D., [[Fred Alan Wolf]] , Ph.D., and Richard Zarro, who were also all generous with their time and ideas.
- Carol Ann Dryer, for her friendship, insight, and support, and for unending generosity when it comes to sharing her profound talent.
- [[Kenneth Ring]] , Ph.D., for hours of fascinating conversation and for introducing me to the writings of [[Henry Corbin]] .
- [[Stanley Krippner]] , Ph.D., for taking the time to call me or drop me a note whenever he came across any new leads on the holographic idea.
- [[Terry Oleson]] , Ph.D., for his time and for kindly allowing me to use his diagram of the "iittie man in the ear."
- [[Michael Grosso]] , Ph.D., for thought-provoking conversation and for helping me track down several obscure reference works on miracles.
- [[Brendan O'Regan]] of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, for his important contributions to the subject of miracles and for helping me track down information on the same.
- My longtime friend Peter Brunjes, Ph.D., for using his university connections to help me obtain several difficult-to-find reference works.
- Judith Hooper, for loaning me numerous books and articles from her own extensive collection of materials on the holographic idea.
- Susan Cowles, M.S., of the Museum of Holography in New York for helping me search out illustrations for the book.
- Kerry Brace, for sharing his thoughts on the holographic idea as it applies to Hindu thinking, and from whose writings I have borrowed the idea of using the hologram of Princess Leia from the movie Star ' Wars to open the book.
- [[Marilyn Ferguson]], the founder of the Brain/Mind Bulletin, who was one of the first writers to recognize and write about the importance of the holographic theory, and who also was generous with her time and thought. The observant reader will notice that my summary of the view of the universe that arises when one considers Bohm and Pribram's conclusions in tandem, at the end of Chapter Two, is actually just a slight rephrasing of the words Ferguson uses to summarize the same sentiment in her bestselling book [[The Aquarian Conspiracy]] . My inability to come up with a different and better way to summarize the holographic idea should be viewed as a testament to Ferguson's clarity and succinctness as a writer.
- The staff at the American Society for Psychical Research for assist- ance in tracking down references, resources, and the names of pertinent individuals.
- Martha Visser and Sharon Schuyler for their help in researching the book.
- Ross Wetzsteon of the Village Voice, who asked me to write the article that started it all.
- Claire Zion of Simon & Schuster, who first suggested that I write a book on the holographic idea.
- Lucy Kroll and Barbara Hogenson for being the best agents possible.
- Lawrence P. Ashmead of HarperCollins for believing in the book, and John Michel for his gentle and insightful editing.
- If there is anyone that I have inadvertently left out, please forgive me.
- To all, both named and unnamed, who have helped me give birth to this book, my heartfelt thanks.
