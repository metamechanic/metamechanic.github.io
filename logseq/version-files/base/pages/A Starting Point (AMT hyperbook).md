sub-title:: Some notes to the reader on method and madness in the M-ness

- Content, Theory
  collapsed:: true
	- No one can read everything. And I don't consider myself a great reader, in terms of depth, breadth, or efficiency. Thus, this work is not a case of collating exhaustive research and _then_ writing and publishing
	- This work won't evolve as perhaps the usual non-fiction writing might.
		- Do a literature survey of all relevant works. Exhaustive reading list.
		- I contend that, in most cases, such a 'broad' literature survey is a priori pre-defined by what one already considers legitimate or valid sources.
		- As is mentioned elsewhere, this reflects a dynamic of the ego: seek out evidence for what one has already determined to be true, as well as make tools that will return confirmation of such truth, while twisting, eliminating, devaluing, dismissing, ignoring any views or evidence to the contrary.
	- This work, instead, starts from first principles and intentional biases. Part of my goal in writing this is to also uncover unconscious biases through writing, dialogue and feedback processes.
	- Start with premises and assertions rather than (seeming) empirical evidence, or what-if, or
	  collapsed:: true
		- First assertion is that empirical evidence still rests on an underlying assertion of no objective universe but with the forgotten segment of pre-conscious phenomenon production; I see the world/evidence I want, because I made the world/evidence I want, as well as the mechanism to 'see' it.
	- From these metaphysical axioms, postulates and principles are derived.
		- #QTS : What are mathematical axioms?
	- Many of the points here, in and of themselves, are not new. The reader may have encountered many of them before. However, _some_ points may be new and I beg the well-read reader to look for this. Novelty for such a reader may lie in the logical consequences, conclusions or extensions of some points, and/or their synthesis. Alternatively,
	- A central pillar of this work is the role of unconscious resistance, perhaps the most significant contribution of [[Sigmund Freud]]. This resistance plays out many ways, including making us blind to the logical extensions of many of our foundational ideas
	- Complexity.
- Iteration & Development
- Structure, Navigation & Reading
  collapsed:: true
	- Book not meant to be linear yet a passage or section may not be well understood on its own
	- Also not written, in a structural or material sense, in the same way
	  collapsed:: true
		- Block writing; bullet writing; TL-DR writing
		- web writing
		- iterations, versions, drafts
		- easier additions and modifications than paper or even PDF
		- as such, suggested omissions and mistakes can be included and addressed in a subsequent version, based on feedback from readers & critics.
		  collapsed:: true
			- these suggestions can be included/addressed at the appropriate level of granularity in the hyperbook and accessed through various/multiple entry points, unlike a book/PDF. They need not occupy higher orders of importance/visibility than they require. They can be situated closer to their source/trigger point.
	- Same/similar content is listed and accessed through multiple lenses. It appears in multiple locations. (This is one of the powers of Logseq and modular, transclusive writing)
	- Same or similar ideas are expressed in more than way to encourage understanding.

	- Another M-Theory is a simple introductory text on applied metaphysics, offering a model of God-Universe-Space-Time Organization (GUSTO) that may assist efforts for peace and prosperity in a world of suffering and separation.
	- The ideas in this book may not be new to you. Their aggregation, however, as well as understanding of their philosophical and practical consequences, may be new, provocative and challenging.
