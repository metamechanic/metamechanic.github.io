- Members are cognitive psychologists and include some of the most distinguished researchers in the field. Members of the Society conduct research on questions including memory, learning, problem solving, decision making, language, attention, and perception. Many are concerned with the application of psychology to health, technology, and education. Our most innovative research uses converging methods from behavioral measurement, neuroscience, computational modeling and other fields to achieve our research goals. What brings us together is that we study the basic, fundamental properties of how the mind works by using behavioral techniques to better understand mental functioning.
