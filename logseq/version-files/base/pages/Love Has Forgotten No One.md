	- You want to think of that person as being unlimited. Instead of thinking of them as being part of it, you want to think of them as being all of it. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=372))
		- **Note**: Yes
	- It’s the way you think that constitutes spiritual sight. ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=392))
	- there are other ways of helping to undo the ego. As you know, the big one is forgiveness, ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=413))
	- But another would be to put the Holy Spirit in charge. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=414))
	- putting the Holy Spirit in charge absolves you of guilt. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=417))
	- you are actually undoing the idea of separation in your mind ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=418))
	- The cause is the projector in the mind, and that’s where the work has to be done. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=423))
	- The real prayer is when you become silent and join with God in perfect oneness and get lost in God’s love. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=430))
	- Beyond the body, beyond the sun and stars, past everything you see and yet somehow familiar, is an arc of golden light that stretches as you look into a great and shining circle. And all the circle fills with light before your eyes. The edges of the circle disappear, and what is in it is no longer contained at all. The light expands and covers everything, extending to infinity forever shining and with no break or limit anywhere. Within it everything is joined in perfect continuity. Nor is it possible to imagine that anything could be outside, for there is nowhere that this light is not. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=443))
	- The old-fashioned, Newtonian, subject-and-object kind of forgiveness is useless— ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=484))
	- True forgiveness releases people because they haven’t really done anything, because you’re the one who made them up in the first place. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=486))
	- What you’re seeing is your projection of a universe of time and space. You’ve taken responsibility for making it up, not in a bad way but in a powerful way. Now you’re coming from cause and not effect. This is the thought reversal that the Course is talking about. ([Location 487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=487))
	- First, you have to stop reacting to the world, which makes it real. You have to stop thinking with the ego. If you catch yourself judging or condemning anything or anybody—or starting to feel a little uncomfortable, anxious, or even angry—you can be sure that’s the ego. The Holy Spirit wouldn’t do that. So you have to monitor your feelings as well as your thoughts. In fact, you’re more likely to act out of your feelings than anything. Yet your feelings come as a result of what you think. Once you stop thinking with the ego, you can start thinking with the Holy Spirit. You can’t do both at the same time. They represent two complete and mutually exclusive thought systems. So you switch from the ego to the Holy Spirit, and that’s the Holy Instant. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=518))
	- You realize the guilt is not in them but in you, except it’s not really in you either, because the whole concept of guilt was made up by the ego to make it real! So the second part is you realize the ego made the whole thing up, and that what you’re seeing is not true. There is no universe of time and space. There is only a projection of a universe of time and space. So you’re not a victim of it. There’s no power in being a victim, but there’s plenty of power in being at cause. Then the third thing is you change your mind about it. You choose once again, as the Course puts it in the last section of the Text. You overlook the body and choose to think in terms of spirit. You stop making it real and look past the veil to the truth, which is innocence everywhere, because God is everywhere. Nobody’s guilty, including you. All is released to the Holy Spirit in peace. As you practice, you find that this process can be done more and more quickly, because it becomes a truth that you just know. Plus, you’re getting so used to the idea of the world coming from you instead of at you, it becomes more and more impossible for you to react to it the way you used to. Now forgiveness is justified.

	- it’s also the form of travel that most aliens use to visit Earth. ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00EA8UEZ4&location=669))
