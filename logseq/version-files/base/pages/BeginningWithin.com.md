- ## Here are some basic Beginning Within principles:
- The only person I can change is myself.
- Be that which you want to see in others.
- Be healthy, don’t be right.
- I can own my feelings. No one can make me feel anything.
- To be free is to always take 100% responsibility by asking, “What are my choices?” Then choose!
- If I am angry I am wrong. To be enslaved is to be a victim. Never ever blame something else or someone else.
- Life is endowed to me for a purpose.
- We choose whether to embrace our purpose or run from it.
- G-d isn’t out to get us. He loves us.
