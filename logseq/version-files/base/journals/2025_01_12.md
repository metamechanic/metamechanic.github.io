- TODO [#A] #[[ACIM TT]] review term templates; need to include verb conjugations for each tense
- TODO [#B] #ACIM-TT word lists for each language from [[Sketch Engine]]
- TODO [#C] #ACIMTT consider making corpus in #[[Sketch Engine]] for each ACIM language edition. Requires 9 Euro subscription.
- TODO [#B] #ACIM-TT make a separate list of the most-most-most common words; words that are so common that to make their own note would cause too many links to be identified eg. as, that, and, of etc. Do for each language. Limit to 50 or 100. Prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions, core verbs eg be, do, have, can, will
