- An idea for publishing #[[Metamechanic Mycelium]] to the web in phase 0 - 1. I just need to figure out how to do the coding.
	- write in logseq with markdown and export
	- export to Github Pages, Vercel, Netlify...
	- apply HTML and CSS via Jekyll and or via YAML
		- particularly want templates for encyclopedia cards
	- use YAML to encode link labels/types between md docs (logseq pages)
	- use markpress to create an #impress-js type site where appropriate eg. EFA, argument maps
	- need templates in logseq ?
