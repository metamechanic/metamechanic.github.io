- TODO [#A] #[[ACIM TT]] link glossary terms (as in create links). This involves creating block ref/link. May need sentence superscript or reference.
- TODO [#B] #ACIM-TT make sure there is no conflict between official #[[Glossary and Index for A Course in Miracles]] terms and my ACIM-TT terms. Move any glossary terms from terms folder into glossary folder; deduplicate similar and ambiguous expressions
- TODO [#B] #ACIM-TT check glossary text references: check for extra spaces, incorrectly recognised letters/digits by TextSniper; alphabetical order within each page
