- Notes to self:
  collapsed:: true
	- don't just use any M-words for its own sake. Be selective, critical, high-quality
	- are these terms below tags in the mycelium, or are they actual entry titles?
		- They could be links to tags but the tag entries are filtered for the "AMTbook" tag, or such like. This would/could then reveal multiple entried related to the tag but each with different titles.
		- when writing here, I could consider the top bullet to be the general tag then list the titled entry underneath (while database version does not exist)
			- database version of Logseq could filter by tag AND by project
