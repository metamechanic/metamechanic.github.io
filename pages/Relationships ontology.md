notes:: Should relationships be noun-tags (like properties or attributes) or should they verb/adjective-tags? Tana does "tag" 'is a' X; "attribute" 'has a' (value of) Y. Thought; a person IS an author, a book HAS an author; therefore, all should be nouns since there is interchangeability of noun and verb forms
- alternatively, verb-form makes grammatical and therefore perhaps conceptual sense.
