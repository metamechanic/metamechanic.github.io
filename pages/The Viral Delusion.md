	- [[Polio]]
		- [[Polio]] was "proven" by taking infected spinal tissue from humans, grinding it up with water, drilling and injecting the brains of monkeys, with the monkeys dying or becoming diseased. #[[Tom Cowan, MD]] #[[Andrew Kaufman, MD]] 1907
		- Alternative hypothesis #[[Andrew Kaufman, MD]] Lead Arsenate sprayed against Gypsy Moth introduced species; sprayed in spring; polio spikes in summer
			- Lead Arsenate is known neurotoxin, affecting anterior horn cells of nervious system, where #Polio is known to affect.
		- #[[Jim West]] Carbon tetrachloride introduce on cotton
		- #[[Larry Palevsky, MD]] [[DDT]] as cause for polio, as #neurotoxin
		- #[[Claus Kohnlein, MD]] [[DDT]] effects on cattle paralysis acknowledged in veterinary  and animal science literature
		- #[[Jim West]]: [[Morton S Biskind, MD]] , [[Mobs]] and [[Ralph Scobey, MD]] wrote that #DDT was cause of #Polio in about 1949
		- #[[Andrew Kaufman, MD]] [[Electron microscope]] invented in 1920; could not identify a particle which was the polio virus;
		- #[[Stefan Lanka, PhD]] : [[John Franklin Enders]] - shortcoming in his process, article from 1954
	- #measles
	- #[[Andrew Kaufman, MD]]
		- Viruses have not been isolated
		- Tissue cultures contained
		- One experiment to
			- prove virus, and
			- manufacture vaccine
	- #Salk vaccine caused much illness
	- definition of "Polio" changed after introduction of vaccine
		- prior: 1 day of paralysis
		- after: 6 months of symptoms
		- yet most children detoxify themselves
		- this led to false attribution of vaccine being the cause of reduced infection rates
	- [[Acute Flaccid Paralysis]] -
		- same symptoms as #Polio
		- 470,000 cases in India but can't call it "polio" as they have been vaccinated #[[Tom Cowan, MD]]
	- #[[Tom Cowan, MD]] was sent approx 50 #Articles showing the "isolation" of #COVID-19 by both orthodox and alternative virology communities
		- all papers used the exact same process - that of [[John Franklin Enders]]
			- monkey cells + fetal bovine serum + streptomycin / penicillin + a possible variant
		- [[Viruses (journal)]] 2020, 12, 571
			- "...However, to date, a reliable method that can actually guarantee a compete separation does not exist."
	- #[[Stefan Lanka, PhD]]
	- #[[David Rasnick, PhD]] : #ebola is also a hoax
		- nobody has isolate the virus
		- one of biggest outbreaks happened in abandoned mine
		- no contacts became sick
		- arsenic used at this mine, amongst other chemicals

		- [[Black Death]] aka [[Bubonic Plague]] not caused by rat fleas carrying bacteria
		- instead atmospheric data from tree-rings and #Greenland ice cores
		- High concentrations of ammonia in atmosphere
		- Alternative theory: comet

		- #smallpox in #LatinAmerica was the result of barbarism of #conquistadores and subsequent psychological trauma, starvation, poor dietary conditions, humiliation, bed bugs, unsanitary conditions, working in gold mines with #mercury poisoining etc
		- Leicester, UK and Cleveland, Ohio, USA introduced improved sanitation and stopped #smallpox #vaccine and saw improvement in health. late-1800's
		- the story of [[Dr Charles Creighton]] in the 1889 or so, who went to write definitive, authoritative encyclopaedia Brittanica entry for vaccination and #smallpox and found there to be no proof; called it superstition.
