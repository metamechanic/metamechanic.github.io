		- ### Summary
		  EFA may be summarised in the following points:
			- A community-curated, expert-moderated data portal around poverty, peace, prosperity, happiness, health and wealth, operating at multiple levels of analysis.
			- One-stop data shop on indicators, statistics, insights and commentary across economics, development, psychology, technology and trends for the general public.
			- A graphical narrative cohering multiple inadequacies, insufficiences, excesses and wastes, and their potential solutions, into a unifying framework.
			- A centralizing hub for producers of rigorous research and generators of high-quality data so that their contribution can be situated into a bigger picture and grander, coherent, explicit narrative.
			- A simplification (but not too much!) and distillation of the overwhelming, complex, universal issue of insufficiency and inadequacy.
