- Akkad was the northern (or northwestern) division of ancient Babylonia where the [[Tigris river]] and [[Euphrates river]] rivers come close. The first people were predominantly Semitic, and their language was Akkadian. To the south of Akkad was Sumer, the southern (or southeastern) part of ancient Babylonia. This was home of non-Semitic people known as Sumerians.
  Akkad was taken from the city of Agade, founded by the Semitic Sargon about 2300 BC. [[Sargon]] united the city-states and ruled much of [[Mesopotamia]] . After the fall of Sargon's dynasty in about 2150 BC, the area was ruled by Sumerians and Akkadians. Under the kings of Akkad, their Semitic language, known as Akkadian, became a written language made with the cuneiform system of writing.
