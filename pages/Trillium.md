- #software #note-taking
- I like some features of this:
	- relationship maps
	- note maps
	- attributes in header of notes -
		- can create templates of notes with those attributes laid out like a table/form
		- attributes can be relationship types, which auto-fill from list
	- Argument Maps, as a particular type of relationship map
		- could enter standard argument relationships as pre-set relationship types
	- Other knowledge framework structures eg. CLA
	- Notes can sit in multiple places in hierarchy
	- Can export to html
		- Paid hosting could be stand-alone website
	- Note maps/graphs show both internal wiki-links as well as conceptual relationships (entered by the user through relationship types)
	- Notes can present in wikipedia/form-like layouts with tables, images, headings, sub-headings
- What I don't like
	- Note entry is clunky, not smooth, barriers. Much prefer logseq or obsidian
	- access to to-do is slow, clunky
	- no backlinks or unlinked mentions type functionality
	- no folded writing or outlining in the note
	- generally, note entry requires too much thought and/or polish
- Could be good for [[Fresh Alternatives]] , [[Global Effort]] where instances could be located in knowledge frameworks
