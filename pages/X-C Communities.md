- Characteristics and criteria are the Policy, Principles & Philosophy
  collapsed:: true
	- Ad Hominem attacks: play the ball, not the man
	- Similarly, identity verification preferred. Have the courage to stand behind your arguments, and admit when you're wrong. However, we understand that some people may suffer professionally and personally if their real opinions and beliefs were discovered.
	- Try your best to acknowledge bias and resistance
	- [[Truth vs truth-tools]], and our [[X-C definition of technology]] or the metamechanical [[Definition of Technolgy]]
		-
	- [[Otherism]]: everyone is something-ist
	- Awareness of filter bubbles and echo chambers, or at least a willingness to concede they exist and could apply to you.
	- Multiple perspectives encouraged; diverse experiences welcome; individual 'truths' are impossible.
	- All technologies (includes ideas) have a useful time, place & situation. Their usefulness lies in knowing the boundaries of usefulness and not over-stepping. Your view is not Ultimate Truth and Absolute Reality.
	- Reality is layered. Objective materialism is _not_ fundamental or accurate
	- [[Truth is stranger than fiction]]
	- If the devil is in the detail, its not a detail
	- Dispute mediation and conflict resolution. Essentially these sites are about conflicting ideas and disputing claims.
	- Say what you mean; mean what you say.
	- Rights are only legitimate if you fulfil your responsibilities
	- [[DIKW]] hierarchy
	- Every person is equal; not every person's opinion is equal.
		- If you frame your identity and sense of worth around your opinion, that is your decision and prerogative but it is not an immutable fact. You can choose differently. We can help with that.
	- On moral relativism...

	- eg. Global Effort won't go heavily into spirituality, but it will probably go into psychology. For that matter, it won't go into "subtle energy". It may go into free energy but not the conspiratorial side of it. This may be in the domain of [[Fresh Alternatives]]

		- Collaboration and Cooperation
		- Collaboration
		  When collaborating, people work together (co-labor) on a single shared goal.
		  
		  Like an orchestra which follows a script everyone has agreed upon and each musician plays their part not for its own sake but to help make something bigger.
		- Cooperation
		  When cooperating, people perform together (co-operate) while working on selfish yet common goals.
		- The logic here is “If you help me I’ll help you” and it allows for the spontaneous kind of participation that fuels peer-to-peer systems and distributed networks.
		- If an orchestra is the sound of collaboration, then a drum circle is the sound of cooperation.
		- Good article comparing and contrasting the two
		  http://cloudhead.headmine.net/post/3279118157/cooperation-vs-collaboration
		- Collaboration is working together to create something new in support of a shared vision. The key points are that is is not an individual effort, something new is created, and that the glue is the shared vision.
		- Coordination is sharing information and resources so that each party can accomplish their part in support of a mutual objective. It is about teamwork in implementation. Not creating something new.
		- Cooperation is important in networks where individuals exchange relevant information and resources in support of each other’s goals, rather than a shared goal. Something new may be achieved as a result, but it arises from the individual, not from a collective team effort.

- Everyone has part of the answer. No one has all of the answer. The possible is only limited by imagination, will and awareness. Truth and truth-tools are consistently confused. Truth-tools are mistaken as truth and thus useful tools degenerate into divisive idols. Science, religion, economics, politics, sustainability et al are all technologies and, as such, can be used to promote peace or reinforce fear.  There is much more to the truth than we think. I/we know less than I/we think I/we do. Yet, I/we are capable of learning much more than I/we think is possible. We’re all looking for the same thing, whatever name you give it. Unfortunately, most of us are looking in the wrong place. Objectivity and neutrality do not exist. Everyone has a position and biases. Often these are implicit or unconscious. This is not a bad thing. However, failing to acknowledge this is costly.
- X-C Communities extend and apply the principles of Metamechanics
	- My own inner journey not separate from the projects, the problems, and the solutions.
	- But...other X-C participants should not have to agree with or enact the Metamechanical principles eg. spirituality, metaphysics

- Reasons I need your help I need help to undertake these projects. Massive help.  This is for 2 reasons:  Alone, I do not possess the resources to accomplish them. I do not have all the skills, the time or the money. Neither do I have all of the answers, if I have any of them.  It is a central philosophy of these projects that any answer lies in joining. Not joining in body or form but joining in mind or spirit. Thus these projects require brilliant, creative and/or supportive minds to share:  Common purpose Unified vision Coherent action
- What is required
	- No assistance will be turned away. If you feel the desire to participate or contribute in any way, please get in touch. Particular assistance is still targeted however:
- Web skills
	- Currently these operations run on my meagre web development and design skills with generous support from skilled friends. The capabilities and aesthetics of each website could be greatly improved.   In particular, Global Effort, Fresh Alternatives and Inner Beginner are specifically web community portals so the latest in Web2.0 implementation would be ideal.
- Writing contributions and feedback
	- Writing contributions and feedback Global Effort, Fresh Alternatives and Inner Beginner all require on-going contributions by operational definition. This will be explicated in each website.  Enough For All and MYWOF would be enhanced with input from all-comers.  Suggestions on structure, methods, knowledge sources, theoretical foundations and whatever else are all welcome.
- Investment Funding, financial support & business development ideas
	- Investment Funding, financial support & business development ideas My vision is that all projects lead to thriving, financially viable organisations and/or brands. Each one will ultimately offer products and services to the broader economy, employing teams of researchers, consultants, web gurus and other support staff.  This may take some time to realise, as with any fledgling investment. Funding and business development expertise are sought to expedite the process and improve the result.
- Support in kind
	- Support in kind Like the ideas and intentions but don’t know how to help? Drop me a line anyway. I’d love to hear from you.
