- From 1872 until his death in 1916, Ernst Mach (of the numbers) strenuously opposed Newton’s claim that the phenomenon of inertia proved the existence of an invisible framework – absolute space and time – of dynamics. He argued that bodies moving inertially do not follow straight lines in absolute space but move in a framework defined by all the masses in the universe. He postulated the existence of an unknown physical mechanism by which they control inertia. This daring idea is known as Mach’s Principle. It was the single greatest stimulus to Einstein in his creation of the general theory of relativity. However, the extent to which it is realised in general relativity is controversial. Mach’s Principle remains an open issue of great relevance to modern attempts to create a quantum theory of gravity and thereby reconcile Einstein’s theory of gravity with quantum mechanics.
- In 1993, Herbert Pfister and I organised an international workshop on Mach’s Principle in Tübingen, Germany. Nearly all the leading physicists in the world who have worked on the issue attended, as did numerous philosophers and historians. The workshop proceedings were edited by Herbert and myself and include the contributed papers, transcripts of all the discussions, and editorial comments. The book has become a standard reference for Mach’s Principle. It was especially praised by one reviewer on account of the discussions, who asked: “When was the last conference proceedings volume that made good bedtime reading?”.
