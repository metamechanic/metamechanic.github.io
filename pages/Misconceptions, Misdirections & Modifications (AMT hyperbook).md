- General, Global, Universal
- Biblical, Christian
- Science
- New-Age
- Truth vs Truth-tool
  collapsed:: true
	- Truth-tools are confused for Truth
- Reincarnation is also an illusion. As are souls.
- the question of evil; evil & God
- Spirituality is about a change of mind, not changing the world.
- God did not create religion.
- Synchronicity, may or may not be, of God
- Sickness is not chosen at a conscious individual level. Anyone’s sickness is everyone’s call to healing themselves.
- God created bodies
- God created the world and the universe.
  collapsed:: true
	- God did not create the world.
	- God did not create space or time.
	- God did not create the Universe, or the multiverse or anything of form
- Jesus is the Son of God.
- The Word of God
  collapsed:: true
	- God's Word is the Bible.
	- God’s Word is the Bible / Koran / Torah /
	- God speaks Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit...
- Interconnectedness (is not oneness). Synchronicity can be of the ego or the Holy Spirit, as can any 'signal'. It can be inspired, or not.
- God is mysterious, unknowable.
- God sends us lessons
- God is judgmental.
  collapsed:: true
	- God is judgmental. Judgment Day.
	- The last judgment
- Consciousness is of God
- God forgives.
  collapsed:: true
	- God doesn't forgive because God never condemned.
	- But the image or symbol of God forgiving is a very helpful tool
- Jesus didn’t know about his imminent crucifixion
- God wants us to be rich. God wants us to be poor.
- God wants to test you.
- God & Jesus wants you to suffer for him.
- Renouncing the world means asceticism.
- Non-violence refers to physical actions. (It actually refers to the mind.)
	- thus much of what is considered peaceful protest is actually very violent
- God vs Occult
- Sacred places. Sacred geometry. Sacred texts.
- On “prayer”. Ie. Prayer is not petitionary. We are always praying.
- Vegetarianism & Food in spirituality.
- Pilgrimage.
- Ritual.
- Science & Religion. Science vs Religion.
- God & social justice
- God & politics, law, economy
- Jesus & the money lenders. "Do not lend at interest" is metaphor
- Resurrection vs the Crucifixion
- Jesus suffered pain on the cross.
- Body, Mind & Spirit (this is a confusion of levels)
  collapsed:: true
	- consequences of:
- Buddha died from contaminated pork
- Jesus was betrayed by Judas
- Prayer is petitionary
- God = The Church
- Temptation. It is not temptation to fall into wild and wicked ways. It is temptation to consider oneself a victim; temptation to judge; temptation to hold grievances.
- Heaven is not attained by death. Heaven must be attained by Life.
- God loves complexity. In fact, he does not. God is simple for God is One, without levels, aspects, components and change.
- The path to God is simple. But not easy. That’s not because of God. That’s because I/we/the ego have made it so.
- Death is bad. Death is pain.
  collapsed:: true
	- (Dying is painful. Physical death is temporary release from pain, the body. Death only temporarily cures pain. Freedom from pain)
	- Reports from the other side
- God is on “our” side.
  collapsed:: true
	- Yes, God is on your team but not “against the other team”. God is on “all sides”. God doesn’t share the same goal you think you do. God would have you be without opponents, adversaries, enemies or others, not by eliminating "them" but by helping you see there is no "them", only You/Her as One.
- Parapsychic powers don’t necessarily indicate spiritual advancement.
- The ego is bad.
- Sin is bad, requiring punishment.
  collapsed:: true
	- Correction: Sin is merely mistake, calling for forgiveness and re-direction. ‘Sin’ is a mistranslation from the Greek ‘X’? which more accurately means ‘to miss the mark’. It is simply an error in direction, a mistake in judgment. In fact, the mistake IS judgment. Just like any archer firing an arrow, a footballer kicking a goal, a singer hitting a key, ‘hitting the mark’ requires practice. Relentless practice, if the level of proficiency is to be high. To hit the mark of peace, love and joy requires continual, patient practice of the untrained mind. Mistakes are inevitable. This is the process of forgiveness – forgiving our erroneous misthoughts until we no longer miss the mark.
- God is not a He. God is not a She..
  collapsed:: true
	- Correction: but there is value to calling It an It, and It a ‘He’. Forgiveness opportunity. And because we think we are human, we relate better to an anthropomorphization, a personality. Our current concept of love is body-based so it may be helpful to think of It as Him/Her. However, to insist that It is a Him/Her is to make a mistake. To insist that God be a She, for example, in response to millennia of patriarchal repression, is to make the same mistake as calling It a He.
	- God is not even an ‘It’. When we say ‘It’ we are talking as if ‘It’ is separate from us. Yet God
- God has nothing to do with evolution
- Morals are handed down by God or result from the genetic survival imperative.
  collapsed:: true
	- (They are expressions of metaphysical law. Ie. God won’t punish you for breaking the ten commandments or disavowing Jesus. Suffering is a self-imposed consequence of not understanding metaphysical mechanisms)
- God did not create religion.
- God deals out Karma.
  collapsed:: true
	- (No. The ego dishes out Karma, because it made need of karma)
- Sacrifice
- Not everything is energy! God is not energy.
- Making friends with your ego
- Spiritual practice eventually means ascetism and going without stuff
- The more I meditate, the better my spiritual practice
- We are evolving towards a peaceful, perfect world
- Turn the other cheek
  collapsed:: true
	- From #[[Urtext of A Course In Miracles]], pp.104-105
	- Turning the other cheek does NOT mean that you should submit to violence without protest. It means that you cannot BE hurt, and do not want to show your brother anything EXCEPT your wholeness. Show him that he CANNOT hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you hold it against yourself.Teaching is done in many ways, – by formal means, by guidance, and above all BY EXAMPLE.
