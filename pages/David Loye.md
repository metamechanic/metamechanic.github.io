- [What the Experts Say](https://www.davidloye.com/experts.html)
	- “In times like these a new worldview often arises at the margins of power, at the periphery of the action unfolding on the main stage . . .David Loye’s central insight...is in my opinion right on the money...The organizing principle of the new faith—a faith of human beings about human beings—is evolution itself. Not the traditionally taught evolutionary scenario dominated by competition and selfishness, but an understanding closer to the original Darwinian one that sees cooperation and transcendence of the self as the most exciting parts of the story.”

	- "David Loye's rediscovery of the 'real' Darwin rehabilitates one of the most cited yet also most misunderstood scientists of all times: Darwin the visionary, the moral thinker, not the mechanistic random-evolutionist as his followers have it. For this rediscovery not only biologists, and not only all natural and social scientists, but everyone concerned with our understanding of evolution on this planet owes Loye a deep debt of gratitude."
