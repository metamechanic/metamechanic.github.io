- [[The Fermi Paradox]] says that
	- If aliens exist,
	- and are ubiquitous and abundant...
	- and the universe is old...
	- then why haven't we seen them?
	- Since we don't see them...
	- therefore they don't exist.
- Similarly, the God-Delusion delusion says that...
	- If God is everywhere, universal and so powerful...
	- then why don't I see him?
	- I don't see him...
	- therefore it doesn't exist.
- #metaphor :
	- cognitive test with 2 (?) year olds vs 3-year olds (not sure of exact ages)
		- cards with colours in different sides
		- "movement of cheese" task
	- ostrich, head in the sand
