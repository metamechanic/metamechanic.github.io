- [Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of ACIM and Christianity – Foundation for "A Course in Miracles"® Online Store](https://facimstore.org/products/forgiveness-and-jesus-epub)
- Synopsis:
	- Now has a different dream come into the world: a dream of the Holy Spirit's justice in place of the ego's nightmare. Now can salvation's joyous song ring out through us from Him to all the world still enslaved by thoughts of sin. What died on the cross was the belief in the cross. What lives is the exultant cry of forgiveness, shouted in gladness by all who choose to live again with Jesus, that this call of love to love will nevermore be silenced. "Let this call live, my brothers and sisters," Jesus asks of us, "and let it live through your forgiveness of the world and of yourselves. Now we begin again, and what we have begun, God Himself has promised to complete." (From the Epilogue)
	- Many students and would-be students of A Course in Miracles have found the Course's Christian context and emphasis on Jesus problematic, regardless of their own religious background. These problems have interfered with many students' study and understanding of the Course. In response to these difficulties, Forgiveness and Jesus addresses the misunderstandings of traditional Christianity, separating these out from the teachings of the Course, and emphasizes the importance of correcting these errors in the context of the two-thousand-year-old tradition.
	- Forgiveness and Jesus first discusses in depth the principles of A Course in Miracles, specifically focusing on the dynamics of the ego and the meaning of forgiveness. The book next presents the teachings of Christianity in the light of the principles of the Course, highlighting the similarities and differences. Throughout the book, special attention is given to the application of the Course's principles to important areas in our lives such as injustice, anger, sickness, sexuality, and money. The person of Jesus is also discussed in depth. The Appendix includes an index of names, a subject index, an index of examples, and a scriptural index.
