	- Don Elkins was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1930. He held a BS and MS in mechanical engineering from the University of Louisville, as well as an MS in general engineering from Speed Scientific School. He was the founder and head of the University of Alaska’s mechanical engineering department in 1960-61, and was Professor of Physics and Engineering at the University of Louisville for twelve years from 1953-1965. In 1965 he left his position as tenured professor and became a Boeing 727 pilot for a major airline in order to devote himself more fully to UFO and paranormal research. He eventually became Captain and flew until his death in 1984. He also served with distinction in the U.S. Army as a Master Sergeant during the Korean War.
	- Before the organization was so named, Don began the work of L/L Research solo in 1955. Among his areas of focus, he used age-regression hypnosis to research reincarnation, talked with and visited UFO contactees all over the United States, often piloting his own small plane, investigated the many areas of paranormal study, and corresponded with and visited a wide variety of scholars, researchers, experiencers, abductees, and many others defying categorization throughout his very active career as a researcher. Don, along with his partner, Carla, published some of that UFO research in the book Secrets Of The UFO in 1976.
	- In 1962, Don began an experiment in channeling using the protocols he had learned from a contactee group in Detroit, Michigan. That experiment blossomed into what became the principal effort of L/L Research: to collect and share information for the spiritual advancement of all humankind. His experiment, as it were, continues in an unbroken line today through our weekly meditations at L/L Research.
	- The Law Of One material represents the crowning achievement of Don’s life and work, along with his other two research associates, Carla L. Rueckert and Jim McCarty.
