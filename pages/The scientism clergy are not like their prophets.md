-
- The people we see in science today - the science communicators and popularizers - I will call them the 'scientism clergy' are analogous to the religious clergy.
	- They promote the religion
	- They are held up and given status by the religion
	- Their thinking is within the (now) accepted comfort zone paradigm. Their contributions are 'arguing over minutiae'
	- The prophets created the new paradigm
- sycophants
- Prophets: Einstein, Newton, Leibniz, Wegener, Dalton, Boyle, Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Galileo
