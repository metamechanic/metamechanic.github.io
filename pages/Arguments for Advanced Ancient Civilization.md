- On each of the location/sites, I should attach a tag for which argument(s) they best support.
- Alternatively, for each site, I suggest how they address each of the arguments eg.
	- How the site fits into advanced engineering
	- How site shows orientation
	- how site has curious logistical questions
	- how site incorporates mathematical patterns
- Not every site will meet every argument; only use the top 2~3 best supported arguments
