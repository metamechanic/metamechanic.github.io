- [Introduction — Coding for Economists](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html)
	- Welcome to the 1st edition of **Coding for Economists**, a guide for economists on what programming is, why it’s useful, and how to do it.
	- The book aims to give you the skills you need to code for economics, while also giving you tips and tricks about programming more generally that might be useful to you. If you’re a complete beginner at coding, we have designed the first chapters to help you get started from scratch. But if you’ve dabbled before, or even if you’re a sophisticated coder, there’s likely to be material here relevant to you too.
