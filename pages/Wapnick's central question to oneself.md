  **Is what I am doing, is what I am feeling, thinking, saying, will this impede my Atonement path or will it enhance it? Will this solidify my being in the ego’s dream or will this help me awaken from the ego’s dream?**

- Because the only thing that is true within this world of illusion that is important, significant, and valuable is: **Will this help me awaken from my dream or will this hinder my progress?** To do this over and over again each and every day would help unify our life so that no matter what is going on, whether it is something we judge as being significant or insignificant, something that arouses great pas- sion, anger or fear, that gives us pleasure or pain, no matter what the form is, no matter what seems to be going on outside of us in our world, it brings us all back within to the decision-making mind. And the only question is: Will what I am doing, what I am thinking, what I am feeling, what I am saying, help me on my path or hinder me? What could be simpler?

- Is what I am doing an interference to my Atonement path and my awakening from the dream or will it help me progress on my Atonement path?
