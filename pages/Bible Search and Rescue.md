- [Bible Search & Rescue](https://biblesr.org/)
	- ## How to use this website
	- Bible Search & Rescue makes results and tools of academic biblical scholarship available to the general public.
	- Two pages offer two different types of information:
	- [***THE SEARCH*:**](https://biblesr.org/thesearch) Watch this page for posts on BASIC INFORMATION about the Bible. Posts will be added with answers to questions like:
	- Who wrote the different books in the Bible?
	- When were different books written?
	- What was life like for people in the times when the books were written?
	- What difference does learning about historical contexts make for how we read the Bible?
	- #### [*THE RESCUE*](https://biblesr.org/therescue) : “DOES THE BIBLE REALLY SAY THAT?”
	- The Bible is often used and misused. Posts on this page will respond to specific uses of the Bible. Specific uses of Bible passages and general assumptions about what it says on various topics will be addressed.
