	- Freud mainly suggests that people believe in God because they continued to need a protective father figure when they become adults due to the unbearable reality of the world. This father figure is a heavenly daddy, cosmic father who can control everything and give people endurance toward the cruelty of nature. His argument is shaped around some main ideas and concepts. These are civilization, nature, human nature, God, father figure, religion and illusion; we will analyze these step by step as Freud did in his book The Future of an Illusion.
