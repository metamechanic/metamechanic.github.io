	  A Secular Age
	  
	  “A Secular Age” is **a landmark book written by philosopher Charles Taylor, published in 2007 by Harvard University Press**. The book is a culmination of Taylor’s earlier Gifford Lectures (Edinburgh, 1998-1999) and explores the concept of secularism, its historical development, and its implications for modern society.
	- ## Key Themes
		- **The Secularization of Western Society**: Taylor examines the transformation of Western societies from a condition where belief in God was virtually impossible to avoid to one where faith is just one option among many.
		- **The Rise of Secularity**: He argues that secularity is not simply the absence of religion but a distinct intellectual and political category that has evolved over time.
		- **The Loss of a Unifying Narrative**: Taylor contends that the decline of traditional Christianity and the rise of secularism have led to a fragmentation of society, with individuals seeking meaning and purpose in various ways, including through consumerism, hedonism, and individualism.
		- **The Search for Moral Sources**: He explores the ways in which people in modern societies seek to ground their moral values and practices, including the role of religion, philosophy, and politics.
		- **The Importance of Christian Moral Sources**: Taylor emphasizes the significance of Christian moral sources, such as the concept of the “imago Dei” (human beings created in God’s image), in shaping Western moral and political traditions.
	- ## Key Arguments
		- **Against the “Death of God” Thesis**: Taylor rejects the idea that modernity has led to a complete rejection of God and religion, instead arguing that religious belief and practice continue to play a significant role in many people’s lives.
		- **In Defense of a “Thick” Secularity**: He advocates for a nuanced understanding of secularity, recognizing both its benefits (e.g., tolerance, individual freedom) and its limitations (e.g., fragmentation, moral disorientation).
		- **The Need for a Public Philosophy**: Taylor argues that philosophers and intellectuals have a responsibility to engage with the broader public and contribute to a shared understanding of the human condition and our moral and political obligations.
