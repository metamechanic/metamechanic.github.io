- ## What is EDAV
- **Exploratory data analysis and visualization (EDAV)** is an **interdisciplinary** field combining
	- Statistics
	- Computer Science
	- Graphic Design
	- Journalism
	- Subject Expertise
	- Psychology
- The **task** of EDAV is to
	- Look for patterns
	- Identify outliers
	- Make comparisons
	- Discover clusters
- The fundamental **problem** of EDAV is
	- Exploration vs. Visualization
	- or, Exploratory vs. Explanatory
	- Explorations reveal information hidden in the data, which is deep and precise but can be convoluted
	- Visualizations offer insight into the data, which can be easily shared but may be misleading and biased
	- These two aspects are not mutually exclusive
