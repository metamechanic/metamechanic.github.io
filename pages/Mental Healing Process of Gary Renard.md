- GARY:
	- This thought process is based on the Course as well as a couple of things you guys said in the Disappearance chapter called "Healing the Sick." I'm gonna talk to you as if you're the one who's in pain. That way people who read it will be able to use the process if they want to. I think this can help with any kind of chronic pain. Of course, everyone on the level of form is unique, and different right-minded ideas work best for different people.
	- This is meant to be done when you go to bed at night. It will put your ind into a healing mode. Then, when you sleep, your mind will work on healing the body. The Holy Spirit plays the most important role, and it would be helpful if you thought about the Holy Spirit and joined with It just before doing this process. Think of the Holy spirit again before you nod off. Don't be heavy about it. Just invite the Holy spirit to join with you.
	- First, when you lie down, think about the painful area and remind yourself that pain, as well as your body itself, is a mental process. Pain is not a physical process. You're the one who's thinking this pain in your dream. It's not real pain; it's a dream of pain, and you're the dreamer. The pain is in your mind, just like the entire dream is. And if it's in your mind, you can change your mind about it. Then, once you're very clear that it's a mental process, tell yourself the same thing the Course says, "The guiltless mind cannot suffer." After a couple of minutes, when you're very clear about that, then tell yourself:
		- I'm innocent, and God loves me unconditionally. All God wants to do is take care of me forever, because God knows I'm just as innocent as God Itself.
		- Picture yourself joining with God and extending into infinity. You're unlimited, free of the body, and totally taken care of by God.
	- Now visualise the beautiful, pristine, white light of the Holy Spirit coming to you and surrounding you. In a minute or two, this healing light is not only all around you, but it's also all the way through you. The love of the Holy Spirit is absolving you of any unconscious guilt you may not be aware of, and you can have confidence you will be healed. You're not alone in this. The Holy Spirit has found you innocent. Then when you're ready, you can go to sleep in the healing love of spirit.
	- Do this for 30 nights, and be open to the possibility that all sickness and pain are of the mind and have nothing to do with the body.
- ARTEN:
	- Very good. You siply thought of your back when you originally used that process, and it worked; and a few months ago, you thought of your hand, and more specifically, your nerves all the way from your neck and shouulder down through your arm and hand. And it worked again fo you.
