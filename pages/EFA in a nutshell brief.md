- EFA is a web-based investigation into poverty and prosperity across all domains and levels of life. It explores the questions "Is there enough for all? If not, why not? If so, why do some seem not to have enough?" It weaves together graphs and charts, arguments and counter-arguments, commentary and timeless wisdom into a coherent, easy-to-navigate story structure. EFA takes the position that everyone is poor, in some way, at some time. It seeks to traverse all aspects of society, all levels of experience, all schools of thought, highlighting the interdependence of particular poverties & prosperities.  Using modern web tools, high-quality research from authoritative sources, and a vibrant community of critical contributors and moderators, EFA seeks to illuminate an overwhelming, complex issue and make it more digestible and hopeful.
