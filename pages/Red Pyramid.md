- [The Red Pyramid Makes No Sense | Exploring The Three Interior Chambers | Megalithomania - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwvcDamoxak)
	- The Red Pyramid is said to be the third pyramid built by Old Kingdom Pharaoh [[Sneferu]] , between 2575–2563 BC. It's red colour comes from the reddish limestone, although it was once covered in white tura limestone (like the nearby Bent Pyramid). In this video I explore the three inner chambers, questioning what it may have been used for. I'm joined by Andrew Collins and Yousef Awyan, and interview Geoffrey Drumm of [The Land of Chem](https://megalithomania.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3f97343da54d3562489acde47&id=5476559745&e=430a463bde) who explains his theory on how it could have being used to produce ammonia. The remarkable corbel-vaulted ceilings and intricate stonework suggests this was built by master masons. The unusual third chamber is higher than the other two and originally had no clear access, with rough-hewn cyclopean blocks revealed beneath the floor which [[John Anthony West]] suggested could have once been exposed to the elements due to the weathering on them. The team also look at the mortuary temple and the remains of the pyramidion which was once on top of the structure. [Watch the video here](https://megalithomania.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3f97343da54d3562489acde47&id=4de928b78e&e=430a463bde).
