- cycle of empire applied to science & knowledge
	- maybe need to tweak; not power per se but perhaps "authority", data fit
	- outsiders "attack" existing theories with new data, better models
	- the new model becomes dominant; incredible success
		- the founders become fathers;
	- the fathers become grandfathers; the 'kids' live off the fruit of the model; the model provides a framework, authority...
	- change is rejected and resisted; new data is not accommodated but ridiculed
