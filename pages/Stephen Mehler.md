- “One of the great mysteries that Egyptologists can never explain is this devolution, this retrograde. You look at the old kingdom, the pyramids, the type of hieroglyphs, the type of jewelry, the type of art produced, and then as it goes forward to the middle kingdom it devolves, it’s less advanced - to the new kingdom when they didn’t even build in granite or limestone anymore but in sandstone a much softer stone, easier to work with.” -Egyptologist Stephen Mehler, “Egypt and the Ancients.” Coast 2 Coast interview, August, 2004 #quote
