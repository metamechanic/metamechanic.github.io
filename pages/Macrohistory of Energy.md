- Or does this actually represent a [[Macrohistory of Science & Technology]] ?
- How does this tie in with Global Effort?
- these are unprocessed old notes from 2009
-
- [[Vaclav Smil]] ’s work and beyond: [[Kardashev]], [[Freeman Dyson]],
- Steam engine
- Internal combustion engine
- Diesel
- Jet engine
- 2nd law thermo
- Theories of evolution
- Computers
- Email/internet
- Faraday and electromagnetism
- Antibiotics
- Immunization
- Fire
- Wheel
- Language/Speech – Writing
- (Look at these and others to show the invention – science process, and methodology. Ie how invention often happens first. Inspiration and realizations in dreams!!)
- Is there a correlation between energy generation types, networks, sources etc consciousness development models? Ie is there an “energy” correlate for each colour wave in spiral dynamics?
	- Eg. Nuclear = blue, renewables = red, firewood = orange,
	- stoves = green....????
- Possible tying of linear Dyson-Kardashev model to more spiritual oriented models is [my hypothesis] that the rungs are climbed through spiritual development of the community/globe.
- (How) Does technology development (automatically) lead to, encourage/foster or necessitate spiritual development?
- (How) Does consciousness/spiritual development lead to [logically, automatically or otherwise], encourage or necessitate technological development.
- On an individual level, one does not need higher tech to evolve spiritually.
- Higher tech can encourage spiritual development through how many means?
- One possibly is through dissatisfaction with the technology, demonstrating it is ultimatey empty; meaningless in & off itself.
-
- Another is possibly a positioning of value in that the tech allows
	- a)People to come/join together or
	- b)The opportunity to consciously consider spiritual themes where they weren’t considered before and
	- c)Higher tech supports/illustrates/proves a higher awareness and broader mind-set exists eg. Discovery of aliens, proof of telekinesis
-
- Look at history of tech change and innovation:
	- Windmills not new; biomass old; new biomass and new fossil fuels techs still new variation of old idea; H2 still the same scheme as petrol, but environmentally friendly.
-
- Trends of technology:
	- Smaller & smaller
	- Brings people together more and more
	- Enables individual expression
	- Enables more and more exploration
	- Decentralizing of power
	- Decentralization of (geo)location, greater mobility
	- Extension
	- Greater understanding of Life (eg. Religion, microscopes, space)
-
- Greater and greater self-expression
- Greater leisure time for spiritual pursuits & fun
- Less limitation (by whatever constraint)
-
- Can energy be categorized by the time it takes for the source to be renewed? And/or the time it takes for the source to expire? Time for waste to appear? Then become hazardous.
-
- Oil, coal, gas: very long time to create. Relatively short time to exhaust.
-
- Firewood
- Biofuels
- Solar, wind, wave, tidal
- Fission
- Fusion
- ZPF
-
- What existed first, will be utilized/employed/realized last...???
-
- ZPF –stellar/solar..planetary creation...oil..animal...human...animal...initial water/wind...coal/gas...fission/uranium....improved solar/wind/water...fusion...ZPF
-
- History of 'energy' as a concept. It didn't always exist. how was it 'invented' as a concept to explain things?
- We didn't know about chemical energy, nuclear energy, magnetic energy, fields... until these structures were discovered: chemical bonds, nuclei, magnetic fields et al, ... So...subtle energies? quantum foam? Microvita? Energies of types we can't yet conceive of, let alone measure
