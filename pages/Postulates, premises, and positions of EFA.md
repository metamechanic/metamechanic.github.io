- #EFA #philosophy #[[position statement]] #hypothesis
- EFA obviously wouldn't set out to begin an exploration without particular ideas about the nature of the project and the nature of the problem(s). Otherwise, why would it have begun and how would it proceed?
- Being at the outset, these thoughts and positions may better be labelled 'intuitions', hypotheses, orienting principles, premises, postulates or similar. These positions will be revised and updated if/when required according to the illumination and insight provided by the exploration and discussion.
- Many of these points may be obvious, self-evident, unoriginal or come across as flippant. Regardless, they will be expanded upon and expounded upon with further exploration and subsequently revised and refined as helpful.

- ## Postulates, premises and positions
- There is a need for this project.
  collapsed:: true
	- In a truly globalised interconnected faster society, discussions around poverty are often complex, opaque, shallow and narrow. Yet the need for effective solutions are as great as ever. More people are increasingly aware and concerned and capable of learning and acting yet stand hamstrung by complexity-induced helplessness and confusion.
- Answers to the [driving questions]([[Driving Questions of EFA]]) are available if we don't overtly predetermine the scope or type of answers.
  collapsed:: true
	- {{embed ((6689a042-f2b9-493f-8ae6-97b3a16012e6))}}
- There _is_ enough for all. Enough of everything exists for everyone and everything.
  collapsed:: true
	- No, not everyone can have a Ferrari. But, perhaps, everyone could have mobility, a sense of adventure, and a feeling of worth and status that such poor proxies attempt to substitute for.
	- No, we can't live forever (we disagree with the [[Transhumanism]] and [[longevity escape velocity]] cults). However, we can face the fears such groups disown and deny and come to deep peace independent of mortal death and not enough time.
	- Similarly for other idols of materialism and ideology.
	- All can have enough water. All can have enough warmth. All can have enough love. Personal choice, cultural beliefs, group prioritisation and global decisions make poverty out of plenty, yet abundance awaits.
	- Having, doing and being enough may, though, require reframing attitudes, interrogating values, remoulding cultures and restructuring systems to transform scarcity into abundance.
	- [[There is enough for everyone’s need, not everyone’s greed.]] ~ [[Gandhi]] ~
- We are all poor. We all lack something, at some time, in some way.
  collapsed:: true
  We are all wealthy. We have resources available to us for prosperity.
	- Some don’t have enough food. Some don’t have enough money. None have enough peace and security consistently or for long enough. However, peace and security - psychological, emotional and material - are available if we know where and how to look and act.
	- We are all addicts. We are all healers. We are all looking for something ‘more’ but we look in the wrong place and keep looking in the wrong place hoping that at some point magic will happen. We create poverty out of abundance in this way. Searching in the right place, in the right way at the right time may alleviate this.
- We are seeking in the wrong place
  collapsed:: true
	- Mo' money, mo' problems. Happiness plateaus beyond a certain income level. Superstar athletes lost after retirement. More approval doesn’t make one more loved. External searching eventually proves empty. Inner guidance leads to wisdom and wealth.
- Worldly reality has multiple levels, layers, aspects and dimensions.
  collapsed:: true
	- This is reflected in the frameworks used for analysis as well as to structure the arguments, an example being [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]].
	- The material is only the most basic and obvious level. Addressing the problem of scarcity and poverty requires traversing all levels and integrating all aspects and dimensions.
- Inner as well as outer dimension
  collapsed:: true
	- Discontent millionaires, drug-addicted superstars, conflicted heroes, and mad geniuses in the same world as happy homeless, patient parents, peaceful beggars and super-satisfied nobodies.
	- Psychology, spirituality and philosophy are implicit in economics, politics, hard science and technology but often dismissed, devalued or reduced to epiphenomena.
	- EFA is open to all data, sources, theories and frameworks which highlight poverty and its theorised causes, as well as proposed solutions. Inner world consideration _must_ be included as fundamental given juxtaposed scenarios above.
- We waste. And we don’t care.
  collapsed:: true
	- Powerful resources are undervalued and discarded. Trivial resources are overemphasised. We throw away or ignore that which could alleviate our insufficiency and suffering.
	- Structures are designed to facilitate this (eg. cheap oil, easily defrauded welfare systems). Such waste penalizes not only through the waste itself but furthermore through lost, ‘higher and wider’ opportunities. Powerful resources are undervalued and discarded. Hollow resources are overemphasised and over-valued.
- Confusion of levels. Levels of confusion.
  collapsed:: true
	- Problems are problems as well as symptoms.
	  collapsed:: true
		- What we call “problems” can be seen as problems in themselves, but also as symptoms of a deeper problem which, like a hydra, produces multiple problematic “heads” when "solved". A deeper source point can be targeted to greater effect. Effective solutions most often address multiple layers of this problem-solution categorization confusion.
	- Insufficiency arises from confusing levels of problem-solution.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Thinking the material is all that is, all that is worthwhile, all that is sought for.
		- Wasting and displacing money, energy and material resources when the problem is calling for something "higher".
		- Wasting time and needless suffering when the "lofty ideals" and "good intentions" get in the way of pragmatic, obvious, basic solutions.
	-
- Effective, practical solutions already exist, awaiting recognition and implementation
  collapsed:: true
	- Technologies and philosophies already exist which would act as part of effective, practical solutions. They address one or more particular layers of reality. They fit together with other pieces addressing other layers, or they acknowledge and address all layers in themselves. They often exist as outside popular culture, on the edge of educated orthodoxy, in the waste bin of ancient wisdom, on the fringe of dominant discourse or the too-hard basket of denial and repression.
	- Many are used but often beyond their range of usefulness. Many are rejected, for various reasons. Many are repressed. Many are resisted. Even better solutions are inevitable but will inevitably be inappropriately used, refused and repressed for the same reasons as today.
	- Existing, standard responses do definitely play a role. The key is in recognising when, where, how and how far. They are often used beyond this as a mindless panacaea which only entrenches lack.
- Quality of quantity. Quantity of quality.
  collapsed:: true
	- Knowing when enough is enough and ascendence requires a category shift. A common characteristic of many systems is that there exists a minimum quantity of resource for effective operation, and another point for optimal operation. Beyond this measure, improvement returns diminishes to the point where it becomes ineffective and even destructive. At this point, a qualitative shift is required, rather than a continued quantitative increase.
	- The hierarchy of needs, facing the resistance to level climbing and self-actualisation.
- We’re all really seeking The Limitless - The Infinite Within
  collapsed:: true
	- ...but we create poverty out of abundance by aggressively and excessively seeking fulfilment from idols outside ourselves. Thus, diseases of poverty as well as affluence, arise.
- Practicing the principles: critique, contribution, curation.
  collapsed:: true
	- 'Opinions are like arseholes - everybody has one.' 
	  collapsed:: true
	  And this is a better explanatory metaphor than most think.
		- Just like arseholes, everyone has the right to an opinion. But no one has the right to be an arsehole in expressing their opinion.
		- Enough Sanitation. Effluent management and related water quality is a big problem for much of the world. Similarly, managing the verbal, literary and mental effluent of the world, and related thought quality, is an even bigger problem.
		- Just like feces, and the arseholes that eject them, not all opinions are equal.
			- Some opinions are better formed, painlessly passed, in the right place at the right time. They support diversity of microbiota, fertilising and promoting broader life systems. Other opinions are loose, violent, recalcitrant, odorous and infectious.
			- The systems and procedures that produce them are of different quality: better cared for and maintained.
	- For this very EFA project to be a success, whatever that means, it will have to embody the outcomes it espouses. Subject and object are not separate. In analysing the world, we are really analysing ourselves. Our own egos become apparent in our critiques. In healing our own sense of poverty and lack, we aid the process in the world, of which we are all integral.
	- Contributors and authors are not preaching, or even instructing; at least not consciously.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Its not our place. In writing about poverty, I am writing to myself. I am mindful of my own inner and outer poverty. In researching scarcity, authors (should) have their own personal inadequacies and frailties in mind as well. Only those with a truly perfect sense of complete abundance (ie. no one) can begin to instruct reflexively. My lack of peace at some scarcity or gluttony in the world, as would be experienced by many others I'm sure, is as much a general topic of investigation as the worldly, broader variants.
- Intentional, transparent bias.
  collapsed:: true
	- EFA takes the view that no one is impartial, no matter what they self-proclaim. There is always an inherent, often unconscious bias. The key is to make this bias apparent, to recognise assumptions and implicit philosophical and metaphysical structures. Furthermore, proclaimed biases may not match demonstrated biases. The key is to reconcile the dissonance.
	- EFA will bias itself towards certain frameworks of understanding, worldviews, modes of communication and presentation. This may not gel with some readers. Such readers are invited to offer their perspective with the view that it may augment EFA. Such contributions will ideally be mapped into the debate around topics. However, it may not be adopted as a guiding ideal.
- We, the world, don't really want to solve this problem (at any level)
  collapsed:: true
	- This is perhaps the most contentious postulate; that we, as a world as well as individuals and groups, don't want enough. We resist and avoid solutions, undermine effective strategies, and sabotage our own and others' efforts towards peace, prosperity and alleviating poverty of all kinds.
	- We _say_ we want to solve these problems but our underlying attitudes and actions, once honestly and carefully revealed, indicate a different story.
	- We remain happy for others to not have enough X if I have enough. We remain 'satisfied' to not have enough Y ourselves if it serves another [often unconscious] purpose. And thus we resist resolution and steps towards peace.
- Complexity requires appropriate simplification but not over-simplification.
  collapsed:: true
	- This exercise is complex. It is the wickedest of wicked problems. Complexity is not solved by added complexity, rather by suitable simplification and reframing. Complexity can mask the true problems and obscure effective solutions. Complexification and the language and other systems around it, can become its own cult.
	- Complexification as a defence.
- The role of 'technology'.
  collapsed:: true
	- Technology definitely plays a role. But what is “technology”?
	  collapsed:: true
		- computer code, AI, internet, genomics, satellites
		- machines, devices, engines, petrochemicals, medicines
		- wheels, screws, levers, planes
	- But what about such things as ...
	  collapsed:: true
		- governance and legal codes
		- psychological methods
		- economic systems
		- agricultural practices
		- philosophical frameworks such as human rights
		- meta-technologies such as science, religion and language ?
	- EFA takes the view that all of this, and more, is technology. Any tool, any instrument, any vehicle, any practice which produces an outcome or serves a purpose - all play a role.
	- How best to use technology? Which one, where, when, by whom? And when NOT? Technology development and uptake must continue, but wisely.
- The role of 'experts'.
  collapsed:: true
	- Experts solve problems, but experts also create problems.
	- Experts disagree, so which expert to believe?
	- Expertise is a function of authority and fashion as well as of knowledge and competency. Who assigns the label of 'expert' ?
	- Before they were 'experts', they were often on the fringe. What changed? It wasn't always them just acquiring more knowledge.
	- As such, EFA is welcoming of expertise and actively seeks it, yet remains cautious and attempts to be constructively critical.
- Guiding frameworks.
	- In its exploration and execution, EFA is inspired and informed by some frameworks that incorporate the tenets of levels of reality, scales of consciousness, aspects of awareness and domains of understanding, their integration, movement between them and growth through them. These include but are not limited to:
	- [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]
	- [[Ken Wilber]]'s [[All-Quadrants All-Levels Integral Framework]], related to [[Clare Graves]]'s [[Spiral Dynamics]]
	- [[Sarkar's circles of expanding consciousness]]
	- [[Causal Layered Analysis]] of [[Sohail Inayatullah]]
	- These frameworks, and others, will be used to understand, critique and improve possible solutions and pathways.
