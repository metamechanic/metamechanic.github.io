- I believe materialism did not arise from scientific findings but was the
  result of a science culture that formed as a result of the pronouncements of the
  Council of Trent (1545–1563), the principal one being a prohibition against

  consciousness, on pain of death. It is a
  taboo that lasted for centuries, and for
  more than three centuries it tortured and
  killed. An unknown but large number of
  doctors, scientists, herbalists, particularly
  village herbal women, philosophers,
  alchemists and others were tortured
  and killed, often by being burnt alive. I
