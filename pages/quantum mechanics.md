- A nice paragraph from [Axiom - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom)
	- In quantum physics, two sets of postulates have coexisted for some time, which provide a very nice example of falsification.
	- The '[Copenhagen school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation)' ([Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr), [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born)) developed an operational approach with a complete mathematical formalism that involves the description of quantum system by vectors ('states') in a separable Hilbert space, and physical quantities as linear operators that act in this Hilbert space. This approach is fully falsifiable and has so far produced the most accurate predictions in physics. But it has the unsatisfactory aspect of not allowing answers to questions one would naturally ask.
	- For this reason, another '[hidden variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory)' approach was developed for some time by Albert Einstein, [Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger), [David Bohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bohm). It was created so as to try to give deterministic explanation to phenomena such as [entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement). This approach assumed that the Copenhagen school description was not complete, and postulated that some yet unknown variable was to be added to the theory so as to allow answering some of the questions it does not answer (the founding elements of which were discussed as the [EPR paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox) in 1935).
	- Taking this idea seriously, [John Bell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stewart_Bell) derived in 1964 a prediction that would lead to different experimental results ([Bell's inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_inequalities)) in the Copenhagen and the Hidden variable case. The experiment was conducted first by [Alain Aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Aspect) in the early 1980s, and the result excluded the simple hidden variable approach (sophisticated hidden variables could still exist but their properties would still be more disturbing than the problems they try to solve). This does not mean that the conceptual framework of quantum physics can be considered as complete now, since some open questions still exist (the limit between the quantum and classical realms, what happens during a quantum measurement, what happens in a completely closed quantum system such as the universe itself, etc.).
