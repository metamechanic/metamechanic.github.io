- # The Naked Bible
  
  The starting point of Mauro Biglino’s work is stripping the Bible of the allegorical meanings that have been attributed to it by the Christian tradition. In ancient Hebrew, the Old Testament speaks by itself, in an explicit and transparent manner.
  
  When translated in a literal way, or “naked”, the Bible  is wildly different from how it has always been narrated: there is not any almighty and all-knowing God,  and there is no notion of eternity.
- ## The Bible, revealed by a new literal translation
  
  **Exposing the Bible: in ancient Hebrew, the Old Testament speaks by itself, in an explicit and transparent manner.**
  
  The Bible narrates of mysterious, superior and powerful beings that appeared  on Earth. Aliens? Extraterrestrial beings? A superior civilisation that has been inhabiting our planet since the remote past? Creators, craftsmen, geneticists. Aviators, warriors and despotic rulers. Scientists endowed with extremely advanced knowledge, capable to create special weaponry and technologies that resemble what we are used to see in science-fiction movies.
- **Once stripped of all unnecessary interpretations, the Bible appears to be very different from how it has always been narrated**: it does not contain a spiritual, almighty and all-knowing God. There is  no concept of eternity. No apples, nor slithering  tempting  serpents. No winged angels. Not even the Red Sea: the people of the Exodus simply fords  a bed of reeds.
