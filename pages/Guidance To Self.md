		- I share my workings in case anyone is interested
	- My work, and any success I may have, does not determine my worth
		- My worth is independent of success and failure, difficulty and ease, fame and forgottenness, fortune and poverty

		- the well-rounded path
			- I'm only as happy as my weakest link
		- the fun path
			- work is fun when its
				- not work
				- part of a whole puzzle
