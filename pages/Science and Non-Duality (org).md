- my opinion: not very dedicated to non-duality; "non-dual" in name only, not in outward practice or philosophy
	- it seems to be more about #[[social justice]] rather than [[Absolute Justice]], #woke ideology, and how one "identifies"; pro-Palestine,
- The mission of Science and Nonduality (SAND) is to explore beyond ultimate truths, binary thinking, and individual awakening while in deep reverence of the beauty, complexity, pain, and great mystery that weave the infinite cycles of existence.
- ## Nonduality

	- Nonduality has as many facets as there are human endeavors. Mystics describe the nondual experience in many ways, as loving, expansive, blissful and unitive, lacking any sense of separation. More than just a feeling, the experience conveys deep and liberating insights into the truth of life and death, self and world. Yet life continues to happen, things change and turn, and each turning is unique. Viewing life turns through the lens of these insights creates a fuller, freer, happier life—the beginning of awakening.
	- Mystics and sages are not the only ones to assert and describe nonduality. Philosophers speak of reality as unencumbered by the dualistic oppositions we so often get lost in; a reality lacking such distinctions as mind/matter, subject/object, reality/appearance, self/other, substance/attribute, essentialism/nihilism, past/future, here/there, true/false, good/evil—all binary pairs that cause fracturing and suffering. Scientists, after having successfully used analytic reductionism (“taking things apart”) as a powerful tool for centuries, are now converging with the nondual view, seeing the whole as more than just the sum of its parts. Cosmologists seek a first cause to the universe. Mathematicians describe their pursuit of truth and beauty as a practice for communion with the Divine. Physicists look for the ultimate constituents of matter. Neuroscientists attempt to correlate physiological observables with reported mystical experiences and psychic phenomena. Transpersonal psychologists investigate the effects of those experiences on mental health. Deep ecologists explore the potential benefits of nondual perspectives on sustainability and global health.
	- World religions teach nonduality in their esoteric branches, including Jewish Kabbalah, Islamic Sufism, Christian Mysticism, Hindu Advaita-Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism, Buddhist Shentong, Madhyamaka or Zen, and Taoism. Many indigenous and shamanistic teachings are also nondual in essence. Aboriginal and modern cultures alike explore the realms of psyche—from separate ego-bound mind to transpersonal realms to nonduality—using methods including meditation, altered breathing, music, dancing, drumming and medicinal plants or substances.
	- The arts celebrate and cultivate the experience of nonduality. From painting to filmmaking, music to typography, sculpture to found-object art, horticulture to cooking, poetry to digital media, ballet to Tai Chi, literature to architecture—nonduality is muse, subject and symbol.
	- We hold the space for further exploration by bringing individuals from diverse backgrounds together to deepen the experience of various modes of nondual expression, contributing to the overall health of the global community.
	- The SAND gathering is a celebration of the core truth of existence—that in our distinct and individual arisings and turnings, we are truly not limited, bound, or separate.
- # Mission
	- *Science And Nonduality (SAND) is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in direct experience. We come together to explore beyond ultimate truths, binary thinking, and individual awakening while in deep reverence of the beauty, complexity, pain, and great mystery that weave the infinite cycles of existence. SAND is a place for an open-hearted, authentic connection with people who are drawn together to find out what it means to be a human being, standing at the intersection of spiritual inquiry, science, social healing, and the arts.*
	  *SAND is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization.*
	- ## Land Acknowledgement
	  
	  We acknowledge that our headquarters are on Coastal Miwok and Southern Pomo Land in Sebastopol, CA, and we thank the past, current, and future Indigenous stewards of this territory.
	- ### Perspective
	  
	  In our view, the disconnect from Earth-based, indigenous wisdom began in the very early days of humankind, when male-dominated religions replaced fertility goddess worship as the prevalent cultural vehicle and started pitting humanity against its natural environment. Separation was born: me vs you, us vs them, human vs nature. It was, in a way, an unavoidable consequence of the rise of the Mind and its discriminating function.
	  
	  Much later, with the Scientific Revolution, the liberation of science from religion resulted in tremendous technological advances, but it also led to the fragmentation of knowledge, and to a science no longer engaged with the big questions of what it means to be human, to be conscious, and interconnected.
	  
	  If our civilization is to be saved from its own excesses, it is urgent to answer the longing of those with a deep spiritual intuition who cannot find their way through a religious world so alienated from the contemporary mind. It is vital to give birth to spiritual paths which are compatible with a contemporary view of the world.
	  
	  We also recognize that at the heart of the climate, political, and socioeconomic crises we face today lie the story of separation and the deep intergenerational trauma we carry. The cult of separation has brought dominance and submission, marginalization and oppression, violence toward *the other* along with the mechanistic, materialistic view of life that has shaped our society.
	- ### Purpose
	  
	  At SAND we envision a humanity firmly rooted in the truth of our interconnectedness. We see Earth as a living being and we hold life, in all its shapes and forms, as intelligent, sacred and complete. 
	  
	  We promote a spirituality honoring both the absolute/transcendent and the relative/immanent aspects of consciousness—ultimately one and the same.
	  
	  We are also being called to challenge all the ways in which the realization of our interconnectedness might not be fully embodied. In these times of crisis, we need to be initiated into radical compassion, care and love for all life. 
	  
	  Truth, spiritual or otherwise, is not an abstraction but an ongoing moment-to-moment relationship to life as one interconnected whole. SAND stands for nurturing a community in which we belong to ourselves, to each other and to Life.
	- ### SAND’s way
	  
	  SAND creates a unique forum which brings preeminent thinkers from various scientific fields into dialogue with spiritual teachers, practitioners, and the community at large.  Together, we peer into deep mysteries and seek answers to time-eternal questions. 
	  
	  We cradle the emergence of a spirituality free from dogmatism and responsive to the latest findings in science, and of a humanistic science willing to consider questions of context, perception, meaning and purpose.
	  
	  SAND is inspired to foster a vibrant community of individuals who share this vision; a community which believes that the time is right for the prevalent fragmentation of knowledge and society to give way to a new integrative era in which science and spirituality re-enter into meaningful dialogue for the benefit of all humanity. 
	  
	  SAND provides for this integration by creating a forum for deep and respectful dialogue across disciplines and cultures—with conferences, media, online community and local gatherings.
