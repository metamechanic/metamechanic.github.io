- Synopsis
	- A Course in Miracles is a set of three books, scribed from Jesus, that teach that the way to remember God is by undoing guilt through forgiving others. The Course originated in 1965, in answer to a request of two psychologists to find "another way" of relating to others. A Course in Miracles was completed in 1972 and published in 1976.
	- This dialogue presents the Course's approach to all addictions, using food addictions and preoccupation with weight as the specific focus. In a discussion with three students of A Course in Miracles, Kenneth Wapnick explains the ego dynamics involved, and how forgiveness can be applied through acceptance of the Holy Spirit's purpose of experiencing the peace of God, rather than the ego's purpose of fostering guilt.
