-
- a question must first be asked before a hypothesis can be tested, before an experiment can be performed
- a 'what if?' must come first
- does 'science' then theorize/project within a limited paradigm eg. Ptolemy's orbits
	- as such, is science based on the past rather than the future?
	- is science, and its effectiveness at either explanation and/or technology production, limited by its own paradigm, its assumptions and practices?
- Or, does/can science overturn our 'common sense' idea of the world/universe? think:
	- relativity
		- theoretical until proven by sufficiently sophisticated experiment
		- only evident in non-usual circumstances
	- quantum mechanics
		- same is relativity but...
		- ramifications for reality ignored by materialists; [[Shut up and calculate]]
		- it _could_ lead us to a higher understanding, but...
		- relatively does do this moreso because its effects are more evident 'out there', far away, in space, at high speed, high mass
	- plate tectonics
	- evolution by natural selection
