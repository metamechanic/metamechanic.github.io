- [Verse 1]
  I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
  I never stick around quite long enough to make it
  I apologise that once again I'm not in love
  But it's not as if I mind that your heart ain't exactly breaking
- [Pre-Chorus]
  It's just a thought, only a thought
- [Chorus]
  But if my life is for rent
  And I don't learn to buy
  Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
- [Verse 2]
  I've always thought that I would love to live by the sea
  To travel the world alone and live more simply
  I have no idea what's happened to that dream
  'Cause there's really nothing left here to stop me
- [Pre-Chorus]
  It's just a thought, only a thought
- [Chorus]
  If my life is for rent
  And I don't learn to buy
  Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
  If my life is for rent
  And I don't learn to buy
  Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
- [Bridge]
  While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
  While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
  Well, how can I say I'm alive?
- [Chorus]
  If my life is for rent
  And I don't learn to buy
  Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
  If my life is for rent
  And I don't learn to buy
  Well, I deserve nothing more than I get
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
- [Outro]
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
  'Cause nothing I have is truly mine
