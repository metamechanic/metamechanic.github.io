- [Daniel Dennett (1942-2024)](https://dailynous.com/2024/04/19/daniel-dennett-death-1942-2024/)
- *A great deal of philosophy doesn’t really deserve much of a place of the world,” he says. “Philosophy in some quarters has become self-indulgent, clever play in a vacuum that’s not dealing of problems of any intrinsic interest.” **Much if not all philosophical work in analytic metaphysics, for example, is “willfully cut off from any serious issues”* #quote

- *…much of philosophy is little more than a “luxury decoration on society,” and he complains many of the questions studied in both analytic and continental philosophy are “idle—just games.”*
