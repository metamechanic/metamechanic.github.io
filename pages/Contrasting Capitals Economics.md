- Thesis
	- We must separate finite material economics from infinite, non-material economics
	- They relate, intersect and overlap. We must know where these points are and how best to relate them.
- There are limited materials resources on earth.
	- on a global scale, we are not creating any more water or air
	- at most, we are moving and rearranging atoms from one location and configuration to another
	- net influx of extra-terrestrial new material is minimal
- In contrast, ideas are infinite, in scope, scale and number
- How can we use the same system to value them?
- #qts? Can there be a "third domain" which links the 2 other domains?
- Spiral: circular economics overlaid with upward or downward movement, whatever axis that might represent
- Solving a confusion of conventional economics: our economic goals are material
