- ### Statement from the President
	- “Welcome to the website of the International Society for Science and Religion (ISSR). The relationship between the sciences and the religions continues to attract a wide public interest, and the landscape of science and religion is dynamic and ever changing, ranging from cases of conflict to mutual dialogue and collaboration. The particular role of ISSR is to be a scholarly society that promotes rigorous research on and balanced understandings of two central cultural forces of yesterday and today.
	- Members of the Society examine the relationship between science and religion from the perspective of many different disciplines, from physics and biology to psychology and the social sciences onwards to theology and philosophy. Our membership includes prominent scientists, historians, theologians, philosophers, educators, and others. As an international society, we are very conscious that we live in a pluralistic world, including a great diversity of religions, as well as many different sciences. We aim to make the Society as representative of this cultural diversity as possible.
	- Our activities include research projects and conferences (most of which open to the public), and various other research and dissemination projects; including a You Tube series. On this website, ISSR and our members also publish clear and balanced statements on a range of new and sometimes contentious issues. We aim to include in our membership the leading figures around the world concerned with science and religion, and to advance the exploration of their interface for the benefit of all.
	- Thank you for visiting our website. We hope you will find what you are looking for here. We would welcome your comments and feedback.”
	- #### Niels Henrik Gregersen, President
