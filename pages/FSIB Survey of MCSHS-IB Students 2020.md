- Survey of current MCSHS IB Students
- Objectives:
- Gauge interest for hypothetical FSSF
- If so, what subject could/should it replace?
-
- Stage 1 - reflection on subjects
- Stage 2 - interest in futures
- Stage 3 - would you have swapped a subject for futures? what would that futures subject have to include?
-
- Research Questions:
-
- What were the most loved and least loved subjects?
- How useful were they?

- Introduction
- This is a survey about the future: your future, your family’s future, your community’s future, the world’s future, the future in general…
-
- Specifically it is about the possibility of “studying the future”.
- Phase 0: Surveyee details
- What IB cohort? Year of graduation?
- Gender

- Do you use another language at home? (ie you speak, or your parents speak and you understand)
- Would you consider yourself more...
- science-maths oriented
- humanities oriented
- arts oriented
- balanced, equally-weighted
- In the IBDP, Group 1 (native language), Group 2(other language) and Group 5(mathematics) are all compulsory. For the rest of the subject, you currently do...
- One humanities (group 3), one science (group 4), and one arts (group 6)
- Two sciences (Group 4), one humanities (group 3)
- Two humanities, 1 science

- Select the 5 most important terms for you when talking/thinking about Futures & Foresight

-
- What else would you add to your school life in order to feel like you were being more prepared for the future?
- As you understand the terms and concepts, how important to the future is...
- computer coding
- robotics
- STEM
- science
- history
- psychology

- What IB school subject(s) do you most associate with "the future"?
- What IB school subject(s) do you regard as most valuable in the future?
- What non-IB subjects would you regard as most valuable in the future?
- Climate change
- The government of Italy recent made the study of climate change compulsory in all schools.
-
- Which statement do you
- Italy recently made it compulsory for all students to study climate change. The IBDP already incorporates climate change and global warming into some subjects. How strongly do you think something like "Climate Change: Problems and Solutions" should be offered AS A DEDICATED SUBJECT within the IBDP?
- Word question to emphasise inter-disciplinarity
-
- economics
- psychology
- history
- business
- Would you choose to study this subject?
- untitled
- Big History (repeat similar to climate change)
- what should be the emphasis of a course studying the future
- Match the terms with their definitions
- Inter-disciplinary
- Multi-disciplinary
- Trans-disciplinary
- Given what you know so far about studying the future, could you see yourself changing a Group 3,4 or 6 subject in order to study an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary Futures & Foresight?
- Go to Question X
-
-
- Yes, I would give up my current single group 3 subject to study the future
- Yes, I would give up ONE of my TWO Group 3 subjects
- Yes, I would give up my single Group 4 subject
- choosing assessment modes
- internship/research
- Title of subject, if IB subject
- vote
- Futures Studies and Strategic Foresight
- Futures Thinking
- Foresight for Sustainability
- Sustiainable Futures and Foresight
- Other:
- Title of subject, if not IB
- Futures Studies for Ethical Entrepreneurship
- Strategic Foresight for Ethical Entrepreneurship
- FS for Ethical Innovation
- Transformative Futures for Ethical Entrepreneurship
- Which of your current subjects would you swap to do FSSF?
- Futures Studies, as proposed, is inherently inter-disciplinary and transdisciplinary. As such, it could possibly fall in Group 3 (humanities) as well as Group 4 (natural sciences).
-
- This means you could possibly choose Futures & Foresight instead of Physics/Chem/Biol (Group 4) or instead of Business/Psychology/History (Group 3).
-
- With this in mind, which subject do you think you would swap out in order to study Futures & Foresight?
-
- “None” needs to be first option.

- 2nd science. If so, which science
-
- 1st
- 2nd humanities. If so, which humanities.
