- [Kabbalah | Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org/texts/Kabbalah)
	- Kabbalah is the primary genre of Jewish mysticism, with esoteric works ranging from ancient to contemporary that aim to shed light on God’s essence, the relationship between God’s eternality and the finite universe, and the inner meaning of the Torah. Central to Kabbalah is the notion that God created and interacts with the world through ten sefirot, or emanated attributes and that people can affect God’s actions by influencing the sefirot.
