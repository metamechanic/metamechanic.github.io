- Synopsis
	- The characters of these tragedies-King Lear, Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello-speak to all of us; indeed they are all of us. As the commentary in these four volumes reveals, their motivations and feelings are different aspects of the thought system of specialness we all share; and had these characters chosen the path of compassion and forgiveness-the thought system of healing we all likewise share-the ensuing outcome would surely not have been tragic. A Course in Miracles teaches us that choosing the Holy Spirit rather than the ego enables us to smile at the ego's silliness as we stand free of its insanity and viciousness.
